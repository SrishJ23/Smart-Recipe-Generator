You must use a *zester* in order to avoid getting any of that bitter rind, and when you zest the lemons, zest them onto some sugar from the recipe (the sugar will 'catch' all of the oils).  I also advise you from personal experience to use only the best skinned lemons for the best flavor.",

The syrup is quite concentrated so a little goes a long way. I usually use the zest of 4 lemons, their juice and 1 cup of boiling water and 1 cup sugar. It's good old fashioned lemonade. Use mineral water to dilute the syrup and you get a great fizzy drink.",

My stepdaughter and I did this one afternoon, and everything turned out great; the only change we made was to add more hot water to dissolve the sugar; the amount called for was not quite enough.

I also put a pinch of cayenne in for extra zip.\r\nThe measurements are confusing and difficult to increase the servings for a family. I tripled it but used only 2 egg yolks and 4 TBS of whipping cream (bty double cream not available in US closest thing with that high of fat content is heavy whipping cream).  Over all, I will make it again. My son wants me to throw in some shrimp!!!",

Well here goes: added more chicken, more mushrooms, & spring green peas. I didn't use the green peppers and other than that -- no changes were made and the meal was delicious! Served it on English Muffin toasts. The flavors meld quite nicely and afforded us a very \"luscious\" change. Thanks for sharing, Diane :=)",

I have to admit I kept grabbing an extra taste now and again as I was putting the left over's away. I doubled the recipe to serve 6 and still wound up with enough for lunch tomorrow. Thanks we definitely plan on making this again for future dinners.",

        "Review": "Hubby hates chicken al a king thanks to his service in the Army during the 80s, when they had it as a meals ready to eat (MRE) package. It was the least favorite of nearly everybody in the service at that time, so hubby has an aversion to chicken al a king. Today, I made it for my sons while hubby was away on a business trip, and they loved it. This is a great recipe. BTW, my older son is in the Nat'l Guard, and they no longer offer chicken a la king as an MRE, so maybe that's why he likes it.",

This was such an easy recipe for such a yummy, comfort-food dessert! I was shocked to see the 2 layers form after baking; I assume that's normal? It all tasted just great, though. Maybe too sweet for some, but not for me!",

Then in Step # 7 after pie has been baked it says Combine graham crumbs, gingersnap crumbs, and margarine in 8 or 9 inch pie pan, pat mixture evenly on bottom and side of pan. Then in step #8 it says .Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until edge of crust is lightly browned. I am totally confused . Tristitia could you reread the recipe , I am totally confused on the crust. \n\nThanks",

Unfortunatly it doesn't say what to do with the margerine or when to add it...so I put it in with the oil.  For the glaze there is suddenly a mention of confectioners sugar..but none in the ingredients list..so no idea how much was needed. I improvised but it's annoying to have to stop and figure stuff out when you're right in the middle of the whole thing.  The cake itself was quite heavy, but my husband likes a heavy cake, so that was OK and the flavour was good, as was the filling.  ",

        "Review": "I give this recipe a good to high rating because it just tastes good and is realitivly easy to make.  I used Cream Sherry as I didn't have any Marsala, and it turned out really good. Broiling the cheese is a really good idea, its adds just a little crunch that makes this dish supurb!",

Also, as a variation I made it with pork chops, except I substituted the broth with apple juice, water, spiced vinegar, a touch of mustard and cinnamon.  Also, very good.  Both ways, definitely a keeper.",

        "Review": "This was easy enough to make (though, it took me longer because I could only cook two chicken filets at a time).  Very tasty.  If you use noodles, I would suggest to double (and perhaps triple) the amount of sauce (simmered chicken broth and marsala) at the end because it goes great over the noodles (I also recommend egg noodles for this dish).  Will definitely make again.",

In spite of its great rich flavor, this recipe is much lighter than I expected. Easy to put together.  I did as one reviewer suggested and made the entire sauce recipe and only two chicken breasts (DH likes lots of sauce), and it was the perfect amount for our taste.  Served over fettucine with roasted asparagus on the side. This recipe's a keeper!!",

I didn't have anything but white cooking wine and burgundy.  Did less than called for but upped the chicken broth.  Also didn't have fresh parmesan cheese :( but since I doubled the sauce, the chicken was almost floating.  Sprinkled the pre-grated parmesan and then covered with mozzarella.  Everyone of my family loved this.  Great quick chicken meal.  I will be stocking the staples for the future!",

I sauteed onions and garlic in the same pan after I removed the mushrooms.  To the sauce mixture I added dried oregano and thyme and added back the onions and garlic to let it all reduce together.    I served with mashed potatoes.",

        "Review": "First Jimmy let me say that the taste was great! the reason I only gave 3 stars is because of the way the recipe was written, and wantedmaybe new cooks to have a heads up. It looks like a down home cake, not an upscale restuarant cake.  My family loves down home cakes. However, there is a few problems with the recipe itself In step 3 it says to add the oil, but the list of ingredients does not have oil .  I added 1/2 cup and it worked out fine.  and in your instructions you never mentioned the applesauce. I added this with the rest of my ingredients.\r\nLove the texture, lots of different things going on with the walnuts carrots raisins and coconut.  I had never thought of using five spice like this and the flavor turned out great.\r\nthanks Jim",

        "Review": "I made this according to the recipe, with no substitutions. The cake tested done and looked beautiful out of the oven, but it turned out much too moist for us. It's almost a pudding. I think this is a factor of the comparatively large amount of oil in the batter. Out of curiosity, I checked out some other carrot cake recipes on Zaar, and found that some popular cakes have an even greater proportion of oil. These cakes have been praised by their reviewers as being moist. So I guess it's just us. The cake also didn't seem to be spicy enough. I think this is just proof that we are all different. Thank you for giving me a chance to define my preferences.",

Im a novice baker ( this being my third cake ever) .I chose this recipe from about a dozen carrot cake recipes , because of its ease and also because husbands are critical judges , and this one passed ! \r\nI made a lot of mistakes during the process.\r\nFor one , i halved the recipe, and then i used a bundt whose size i didnt know, as a result of which i didnt know how long to bake it , but baked it for 40 mins anyway !\r\nmy cake ended up looking slightly brown throughout as opposed to orange-ish...obvious signs that it is overbaked :(\r\n\r\ni am yet to taste it because i want my husband to come home and see it before we can dig in !\r\n\r\ni will post on how it turned out ..\r\n\r\nhowever , i learnt a lot of important baking lessons from this cake .. and i really want to thank you for that , marg \r\n\r\nwill definitely make this again... only better next time. \r\nand i will rate it too , then .\r\nThank you very , very much..",

I made it to freeze for school, and the cake was so lovely and sweet I saw no reason to bother icing it.\nThe only negative was that the directions to make frosting seemed a little incomplete - but like I said, it really didn't need it.\nI had to use olive oil instead of veg oil, but the cake was perfect anyway.\nThank you.  Will be making this one on quite a regular basis",

Oh dear. It looks like the dough has been too watery, maybe I should have added flour. I think the proportions had to be changed but being a beginner at baking I don't really know how and what to change. Luckily I still have some dough left so I'm going to use it to make a small cake. Coz yesterday's cake already gone! I give your recipe 5 stars because the cake is even tastier the day after and it freezes well (but how long can I keep it in the freezer?). Thank you!",

    "Description": "This recipe was originally noted by my wife on a cooking show on TV.  It was touted as an Amish recipe.  All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy",

It was like a pie-full of sweet, creamy, buttery custard... it was great warm AND after being popped into the fridge.  Perfect recipe! :)",

It was creamy and I took the advice of the other posts and added a little less sugar and it was great.  My crust on the other hand was good but fell short of my pie plate as you can see in the photo :)  but it tasted divine anyway. I had been baking all morning so my cooking time was only 40 minutes total,this is a keeper.  Thanks Tom",

I followed the recipe as written, although I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup as was suggested by other reviewers.  This 'pie' turned out incredibly greasy and relatively tasteless.  The consistency of the filling is very mushy and does not match well with the flakiness of the crust. I am not sure what can be done to improve this recipe, perhaps I just dont like buttermilk pie.",

        "Review": "I follwed the recipe to the letter, except I took the advice of some others and only used 1 cup of sugar. It turned out great, so pretty just the golden brown that you want, almost like a creme brulee. First impressions when I tasted it, I saw hollyhocks, peonies and an old english cottage garden. don't ask why...lol It is reminiscant of a lingering flavor long forgotten, and it reminds you of something but you are not sure what, but regardless you revel in this pure bliss. and while you are still trying to figure out what this taste reminds you of another piece bites the dust. Heaven on Earth that's what I call this. My husband and Motherinlaw, who both loath buttermilk, loved the pie. this will be a regular dessert in our house. thank you so much for sharing this heavenly recipe.\r\nedited to add: I have since made the pie about once or twice a week, and it turned out beautiful every time. This is such a great recipe and so super easy.",

        "Review": "Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!  Ok, so I have never tasted a buttermilk pie before ( and my BF said it sounded kinda gross...) but my BF's mom was talking about this great pie she had eaten at some small mountain cafe.  It got me interested and since I had a lot of buttermilk left over from a ranch dressing I had made, I decided to give it a try.  I am sooooo glad I did.  I didn't really know what to expect, except from reading from the other reviews that it was sweet, creamy and custard-like.  All of which appealed to my taste buds!  This pie was super easy to mix up and pour into the pie shell.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup... and it was the perfect sweetness for us.  My pie cooked up golden brown and delicious in 60 minutes total cooking time.   I am baking up another one this weekend to take to my BF's mother to surprise her...  Thanks for posting!",

        "Review": "Good pie!  It kind of reminded me of a cobbler without the fruit.  Next time, I will try adding some fruit in it to see how it works then.  I did not sift flour with salt.  I put the salt in with the eggs and just spooned the all-purpose flour in straight out of the bag...  I paired this recipe with a pie crust recipe found on this site (Recipe #20984).  I used my stand mixer with the whisk attachment to complete this Amish pie journey into delightful bliss...  My pie top was darker than the pictures with this recipe, but it didn't effect the taste at all.",

It makes me want to devise other mix-ins because the pie is so creamy and seems like it would be a perfect flavor base for some embellishment.  It is delicious all on its own though, with a great buttery vanillaness.  Perfect with coffee.",

To one of these (my dads) I added 1/4 cup of Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon (he works at the distillery, I add bourbon to almost everything!) and also made a few cups of bourbon whipped cream to serve over it. It was GREAT with and without the bourbon!\r\nNote: If you decide to add the bourbon start with a couple of tablespoons and then add to taste from there. If you go the entire 1/4 cup cut the buttermilk back by a couple of tablespoons.",

My 11 yr old, husband & myself cleaned out plates. I also did what most reviewers did by reducing the amount of sugar to 1 cup. Perfect. Thanks so much for posting!",

Thank You so much for this wonderful recipe. I came across it while looking for ways to use up extra buttermilk. We had never even heard of buttermilk pie before.",

Sweet and warm, this is a great alternative to traditional pies.   Good cold too. Have made with frozen pie crusts as well as home made.  I use the powdered shelf stable buttermilk, so this can be made easily with on hand ingredients.  Thanks!",

I used FF Buttermilk that I needed to use up, 1 c of sugar and I added the vanilla in to the mix at some point- the instructions don't say where. Anyway, I omitted the crust entirely and greased a glass pie pan. Baked as directed, first for 10 mins at 400, then 50 mins at 350 and ended up with a really thin and light and creamy custard with a caramelly top. I would serve with berries, but for the 2 of us, it was just a great sweet treat without a lot of fuss. We're keeping it!",

I put a covering around the edge of the pie while it baked so the crust would stay nice, and not get too dark because of the amount of cooking time. I made it for my grandchildren who would never want anything with buttermilk, and didn't tell them until they ate it. They loved it, and have asked for it again. YUMMY! Thanks for the posting. It's a keeper.",

Never tasted this before but we had a friend over also - we all raved about it. Only thing different I did was use up all the buttermilk I had in the fridge which was 1/2 cup extra buttermilk. THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nPS:  I use Baker's Sugar because it is finer than regular.  I have tried this twice now using pre-made shell of shortbread and nilla wafer. I also used water bath to cook in out of habit, but not needed.  This turns out perfectly each time-no problems!",

        "Review": "This pie is delicious!! I made one with the full amount of sugar,and one with about 1 1/4 cups. since i have quite a sweet tooth i liked them both. I kicked the temp down to 350 as soon as i put the pie in the oven so it wouldnt burn before set. Also placing a layer of foil over the pie can keep it from burning before the pie is set. I did add about a tablespoon of lemon zest to give it kind of a kick and it turned out really good. I plan on making several of these during the holidays for friends and family. Thanks for posting this!",

Both were delicious!! I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup, as others did.   Cooking custardy-pies is always tricky for me.  I make a loose foil \"tent\" over the whole pie with a slit on top for steam to escape.  If it needs browning, I'll remove the tent 10 or 15 minutes before the baking time ends.  Thank you for sharing this treasure of a recipe!",

I can't believe how simple it was to make.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup, like many of the other reviewers recommended.   It was perfectly sweet. I love nutmeg in custard sweets, so I added just a touch. I think I may reduce the butter just a tablespoon or two; I had to sop up some of the the butter that had pooled a bit on top of the pie with a paper towel once it had come out of the oven.  But really, absolutely perfect pie. Great texture, great flavor. Delicious!!!\n\n... I made it last night and I need to make another tomorrow.. it's almost gone!!!",

        "Review": "This pie is absolutely amazing, very easy to make, and hard to mess up.\nI cut back to just a little over a cup of sugar after reading some of the other reviews, but I messed up and put in a whole cup of butter instead of a half. I also turned up the oven to 450 and then cut it back to 350 and set it to bake for 55 minutes after the recommendation of another reviewer, but at the end of that time it was still soupy in the middle, so I just left it in and kept testing the center. I jiggled kept watching it, and discovered that the best test for done-ness is the jiggle test - when it goes from being runny to being gelatinous and wiggly in the center, it's done. It took more like an hour and 15 minutes at 350, but in the end it had a lovely golden caramelized top, the edges were golden and not overly done, and it was rich and delicious. I served it to a small group of friends and we all just loved it. It is a more custard-like version of pecan pie, with a creaminess replacing the corn syrup-ness. It has an old-timey, southern comfort-food personality. You will LOVE this pie.",

After making these pies many times, I'd like to share my modifications, which I think really help the flavor: add 1 1/2 tbsp. fresh squeezed lemon juice to the filling and then sprinkle nutmeg on top of the pie before baking. Two small things I think make a BIG difference. The photo shows what a well-made Buttermilk Pie should look like -- not too brown, but golden and cracked.  Enjoy!",

        "Review": "This really is five stars but having those ingredients listed out of order I almost forgot to add a few ingredients. Used sour milk which I soured more with added white vinegar. This was better than I had anticipated. I made my own crust and lightly sprinkled the top of the pie with freshly grated nutmeg before baking. The edges were covered with tin foil the last 1 hour of baking to avoid burning the crust and I did reduce the sugar down to one cup replacing one quarter cup with dark brown sugar. Will make again. PS I used my posted Recipe #482203 and it was a great combination with this custard pie! Thanks!",

My grandmother made a similar pie but she never wrote anything down so I haven't been able to replicate her buttermillk pie.  <br/><br/>I was worried when I poured the pie into the crust because it looked like it had curdled and I was afraid I had messed something up even though I had followed the recipe exactly.  I did turn the heat down to 300 degrees for the last 10 minutes.  My pie was beautiful and delicious and exactly how I remembered my Grandmothers!  LOVE it.",

        "Review": "I was asked to bake a buttermilk pie for one of my uncles.  This was a sure fire hit.  Didn't look too pretty and the butter boiled out over the top of the pie and I had to clean the oven...but it was so good!  <br/><br/>I went back after I made the pie and read back over the instructions...when I got to the part about, him liking it better warm, but not too hot , because it would be like napalm, I laughed so hard I nearly peed my pants!  It's been a stressful year...and that laughter was far better than any piece of pie!  Because really, if you ate this pie to hot, it really would be like napalm!  Any way, silly, I guess.  But thanks for posting this so many years ago...I needed the laughter!",

        "Review": "Delicious!  Have never even heard of this before now.  I was just looking for recipes to use up the small amount of buttermilk I had without me having to make biscuits for the fam.  This is a wonderful light custard pie.  I did cut back on carbs by using all Splenda as another reviewer before me did, and I didn&#039;t make a crust, just pouring the batter into a greased glass pie plate.  I tented with foil to avoid over-browning this, but it didn&#039;t really brown at all, probably due to the Splenda.  I did get some cracks, so next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I&#039;ll do this in a water bath to keep it moist.  I might also try this with a low carb nut crust the next time just to see what it&#039;s like.  Thanks so much for sharing!",

I made this according to the recipe, subsituting half of the sugar with splenda due to guilt. The result was very simple and tasty (not eggy), reminded me of a firm bavarian cream donut filling with a slightly caramelized top. My hubby fell in love at first bite, this will be a regular at our house. I would like to experiment with adding slivered almonds or shredded coconut to change the texture a bit.",

I made mine with 1-1/4 c sugar (1/4 c less than recipe calls for) and grated some fresh nutmeg on top before baking. I did end up having to loosely cover the entire pie for the last 20 minutes to prevent over browning.  I agree with the OP that the pie is best when still warm from the oven, and it&#039;s incredible with a little (real) maple syrup drizzled on top!  I will make this pie again, for sure.",

Since I&#039;m always looking for ways to cut calories, I made it without a crust. Crust is not my favorite part of pie anyway and we didn&#039;t miss it. It simply makes it a little tricker to get a piece of out the pie pan intact, but if it falls apart, it doesn&#039;t affect the flavor. YUM!!!",

The only thing I would do differently is have a larger pie shell or use less filling as the firmness of the pie was inconsistent--- softer in the middle.  I am going to try making bars next time - I think it would also be awesome with a rosemary butter cookie crust or maybe even a graham crust. Also, many of the buttermilk pie recipes call for nutmeg -- skip that and add some vanilla bean powder -- d&#039;lish!",

I could hardly eat it and I noticed many left portions of it on their plate. I won&#039;t bother to modify. Going back to my original recipe.",

I find the usual pecan pie too sweet, but this is GREAT and the pecans add such a great flavor. Put a little dab of whipped topping on it and enjoy!!",

Usually, I am known for trying new recipes out and only seldom do I repeat a dish (for a party /gathering) but this recipe, and my friends agree with me, might need to become a staple. I love this one. This is my first experience with buttermilk pie and I'm pleased to find that it is delightfully sweet and comforting in texture and taste, while having such a mild flavor as to appeal to most people.",

I made my own crust and decided to only do half of the filling, since I didn't have a deep dish pie pan, wish I had not done that because I use a different dish. Anyways I added less sugar since all of the reviews talked about using less. I will definitely be making again. Oh, I also added pecans to half of it to try. Absolutely delish!",

I've never tasted or seen a buttermilk pie so I wasn't sure what to expect. I removed the pie after 40 mins when it had turned golden brown and it was perfectly done. I have to say I enjoyed it more the next day served chilled and I just wish I had a little whipped cream to top it off. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I plan to make it again and maybe have fun with some add-ins like blueberries, pecans or spices. : )",

Finally, this is my own personal error, but just FYI: the instructions on the back of my crust said to pre-bake/blind bake the crust for a custard pie, but DO NOT do it.. my crust got burnt, even with an aluminum pie shield.",

I have been teaching my husband to cook since I had surgery a month ago and can't stand in the kitchen too long. I talk him thru recipes and supervise while I sit and watch. He has been doing a good job and actually loves it. He left it in the oven too long, it over browned, but it was good. I disagree with those who say it is too sweet. I think it is perfect like it is. Is there such thing as too sweet? I am going to reserve the last star for when we do it again and don't overcook it. We think it is a good, light pie.",

        "Review": "This was an OK stew, but I had to add many more vegetables and double the base to really make it a meal, which is what I expect when making a stew. Left out the pearl onions and used a white onion, sliced thickly. The flavor of the base may make it worth trying again.",

        "Review": "mmm mmm good! We enjoyed this stew very much.  I used ordinary stewing beef and used sherry for the wine, delicious!  I used less bably carrots and added celery, rutabega, fennel bulb and rather than pearl onions, which are to hard to get, used regular white onon and left out the snap peas in favour of the fennel bulb. I cut all the veggies into large chunks.  Also cut the cornstarch to just one tablespoon  which thickened it quite nicely.  Lovely favlourful stew, I will be makeing again.",

I browned the meat in bacon fat instead of vegetable oil (since some beef stew recipes have bacon in them, I thought it would be good for the flavor) and it was very tasty! This will be my new standard recipe for beef stew!",

BTW, Ordinary tomato is fine instead of plum tomato (and we happen to use  more of it); I highly recommend flat-leaf parsley, if you can find it, because  the curly stuff is not nearly as flavorful; You can use radicchio or any other  kind of lettuce (if you choose to use any at all); The salad tastes even  better the second day!; Flavor is better when served closer to room temp  as opposed to ice cold.",

        "Review": "We liked this recipe a lot because it's very flavorful.  As I've had a chance to adjust the recipe to our taste, it's evolved into something that we enjoy often.  We substitute lime juice for the lemon juice and significantly increase the amount.  I use frozen corn and instead of the fresh parsely leaves I use a lot of cilantro.  As mentioned by another reviewer, I throw in a good pinch of sea salt.  Usually, I substitute a finely minced red onion for the scallion.  I also find that the flavors in this salad improve greatly as it sits, so I try to make it the evening before we want to eat it.  This is a staple at our house!  It's very versatile and my kids love it with some chips or to roll into a tortilla.  Thank you for posting it!",

I threw this all together and heated it on the stove for about 10 minutes. I used a can of seasoned black beans, and I threw in some ground cumin and garlic salt. I didn't use lettuce leaves since I served it hot. Come summer I'll try this as a salad!",

He was the one who braved the cold and went outside to cook it on the grill after I had marinaded two ribs for about an hour. I gave him some extra sauce to baste with and all turned out well. The time it took to prepare and the long list of ingredients used was well worth it. I may even try this during the winter as a slow roast or even a crockpot recipe for ribs as I still have quite a few of them in the freezer.",

I figured I'd find an easy 2-ingredient recipe, but instead, happened upon this one.  Far more effort than the 2-ingredient recipe would have been, but the taste is subtle, complex and delightful.  Yes, there's ketchup in it, but also a nice interplay of flavours that I'm sure will be a hit at our chicken BBQ tonight.  Thanks!",

    "Description": "Chicha (corn beer). Chicha is made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America. Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home. My second crop of corn is about to come in and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in the near future.",

    "RecipeInstructions": "c(\"Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160°F.\", \"We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao/coriander, the other with allspice/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied.\", \"Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora.\", \"Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body.\", \n\"Once the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes.\", \n\"Specifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with.\", \"Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor.\", \"Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off.\", \n\"Traditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling.\", \"Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom.\", \"This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens.\", \"Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles.\", \n\"Also note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash.\", \"Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn.\", \n\"This gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures.\", \"This could probably be sparged as usual.\")",

So I added enough flour (5 1/2 more cups), extra salt (1 teaspoon) and some oil (1 tablespoon - just because) to make a kneadable dough. I continued from there, and got 2 medium loaves (620 g each) and 17 rolls at about 45 g (1 1/2 oz) each. What can I say? The bread is delicious, but it's not really the bread of this recipe. And I'm not sure what the buckwheat flour contributes - maybe some texture, not much flavor what with the caraway seeds. We will eat the bread and enjoy it, but I don't think I'll try this again.  ",

        "Review": "I had just dressed out an old rooster and thought that it would be tough as shoe leather but, not so! This sauce was so tasty and we liked the idea of thickening the sauce. Had so much that I have another meal of it frozen.  We loved the steamed dumplings as mine usually are soggy when I drop them in the liquid to cook. These were light and nice and soft but I will need to add a bit more salt for our taste. I found the flour and butter a little difficult to incorporate in the liquid; it tended to lump.  Next time I will add a little liquid to it before putting it into the pot. But we will definitely have this meal again!",

        "Review": "I increased the flour & sugar just a little based on several other recipes I'd read - but mainly followed this one due to the chocolate chips, and I really think they make the difference (along with the higher amount of cocoa as compared to other recipes).  This was excellent warm with a smidge of ice cream and excellent at room temp with a glass of milk.  I also like the addition of butter instead of oil - adds a bit of nice flavor, I think. (I think this took about 10 minutes of prep though - very easy to put together!)",

    "Description": "This is my son's favorite meal. I make it with shrimp for him for his birthday every year. GREAT for company because it is so easy and yet taste wonderful! I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)\r\nPLEASE NOTE! This is an &quot;authentic&quot; Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere! Recipe #52892 and Recipe #8596 are two good places to start.",

I'm pretty sure I would just like to drink it, and skip those pesky noodles! I just melted the margarine in the pan with the cream and added the other ingredients, and wow, is it good. And so easy too. No wonder your son loves this so much. I do too! Edited to add: It does reheat well, just make sure to whisk the mixture well so that it gets creamy again. The graininess will go away. Great recipe!",

There are so many things you can add to this sauce to ring the changes.  (Marg mentioned chicken, and reviewers gave other suggestions.)  Thanks for posting this, Marg!  (BTW, after looking at your fantastic photo, I decided not to add mine!!!)",

He just went to the store yesterday and got me the ingredients to make it a third time without me asking for them. Last time, I cooked some cubed chicken, mushrooms and capers in a tiny bit of oil, then poured the prepared alfredo over it and served it with penne pasta.  It was so good I thought I could start my own restaurant!",

Thanks so much for this easy, quick and delicious recipe. I sauted bite-sized pieces of chicken in olive oil, with garlic and green onions. Then, I removed the chicken and made the sauce in the same pan. Served over thin spaghetti, this sauce was wonderful!!",

The consistency is different, presumably because there is no flour or cornstarch in it to thicken it.  Mine came out more like a buttered pasta with parmesan cheese mixed in.  Tasted delicious, but not really alfredo.",

        "Review": "Wonderful!  I made this to use in Recipe #101738 -- Twice-Baked Alfredo Potatoes by Peacefulnightdove.  It was outstanding.  It definitely was not thick enough, however, so I ended up using cornstarch to thicken it as some other reviewers had also suggested.  Next time I might try adding 2 Tablespoons or so of cream cheese to thicken, and see how that works.  Delicious taste!  Thanks for posting this recipe!  (I just noticed it is #76!  Posted in 1999 -- Only took me 6 years to find it!  lol)\r\nDianne",

        "Review": "Excellent, excellent recipe Marg!!  This recipe is so easy to make and yields a thick, rich, delicious sauce.  Sauteed 2 teaspoons Crushed Garlic in the butter then added 1 1/4 cups Heavy Cream, 1 cup Grated Parm/Romano and 1/2 teaspoon Course Ground Black Pepper.  Grilled a boneless/skinless chicken breast on the George Foreman Grill, sliced it into strips, topped it on hot Angel Hair pasta tossed with EVOO then topped with the sauce.  DELICIOUS!!  (Tip: If the sauce is a little thin for your taste, just add more Parmesan Cheese or a tad bit of Shredded Italian Blend Cheese to thicken.)",

This alfredo is too heavy and stodgy for my tastes which is probably due to the huge amount of butter in this recipe. The recipe I am used to uses the same amount of cream but only a couple of tablespoons of butter and a third of the cheese. It just didn't have that lightness that makes a nice creamy alfredo perfect for me :(.",

I added left over chicken; some mushrooms would have been good too. Simmer butter & cream for about 2 minutes to reduce, add the cheese.  This will help with thickening.  I doubled the recipe for a 14 oz pkg of noodles, it was perfect amount. Personally, I would put in 1/2 again as much cheese, but that is just my preference.  Extremely easy to make.",

Sometimes I add cooked chopped chicken to the last step or sometimes cooked salad shrimp. It is just good as is. Always a green salad dressed with Italian vinaigrette. I do think the canned parmesan cheese is best for this recipe. Perfection!",

I used margerine, whipping cream, and unfortunately had to use the 'fake' parmesan cheese.  The flavor was excellent, and the sauce wasn't too heavy, but my 'cheese' never melted and made the sauce extremely grainy.  I served it with fettucinni and broiled chicken breast with a side of broccoli and garlic bread.  Would have been perfect if not for the sauce texture!  We will definitely be making this again, with REAL parmesan cheese, and at that time I hope to upgrade my rating to a 5!  Thanks for posting!",

Even after doubling it I have no leftovers.  I used fat free half and half instead of cream.  I had some trouble getting it to thicken so I did use cornstarch, but am wondering if it may have thickened on its own as other reviewers stated.  I will be making this for a special treat in our home.  Thanks, Marg!  Tip:  adding just a pinch of nutmeg seems to make alfredo sauce pop",

I also used pre-grated parm - next time I'll try to use a freshly shredded cheese.  I also added about 6 oz of sliced, sauted mushrooms - yum!  This was so easy that it will probably become a regular weeknight meal and using the FF H&H, I don't feel as guilty!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!",

I couldn't find the cheese I had set out (my kitchen is under construction, give me a break) so I started using the \"shake cheese\" style parmesan and guestimating amounts.  I finally was able to find the real stuff and finished off with that.  Pretty sure that was my problem.  I also added a couple tsp. of dried hot pepper powder because it went with the rest of my meal but left out the salt.  It was easy and fast and pretty tasty.  I'll make it again and make sure to keep track of the cheese. :) Thanks!",

The sauce was fast, simple and I was lucky enough to have all of the ingredients on hand.  The only change I made was adding a bit of corn starch for thickness, a dash of garlic and parsley for some coloring.  Even without the additions, it would have been perfect!  Thank you again!!!!:)",

        "Review": "I used this sauce to have with some fettucine.  It was so good!  I cooked it slow and let the flavors blend together and give the sauce a chance to thicken.  I added some steamed spinach and mushrooms at the end of cooking time and let the spinach sit just long enough to heat up.  It was wonderful.  Make sure you don't get the heat too high.  I think that may have something to do with it getting gritty.  Try cooking it slow and see if you have better results like I did.  Thanks for sharing Marg!",

My husband and daughter on the other hand thought it was the best they have ever tasted. He liked it more than olive garden so that is a big WOW for me. I went exactly by the recipe(Idid add some chicken to the noodles that did seem to help some) still I was not that happy with it. But I will give it 3 stars just because of family if it were just me it would only get 1 star.",

Then I thickened a bit with 1  t. cornstarch. Before serving, I stirred in chopped bacon for a carbonara flair. Served over thin spaghetti and topped with scallops lightly fried in the bacon grease.

I also added a heaping tablespoon of garlic paste just cause I like it. I think the butter could be cut back a bit but otherwise with these adjustments it turns out great. Another way to thicken might be to cook some flour with the melted butter in the first step.",

It did need to be thickened, and we used some Wondra flour mixed with cream and added it in.  The 2yr old gobbled it up, and she has not eaten that good in a WHILE.

I had all the ingredients and I am positive this was so much better than I could have bought.  I did cook this on the stove & also added a little garlic and a cornflour mixed with water to thicken it.  I used it in a recipe to make shrimp & scallop crepes which were superb.  There is a little sauce left which I think will be wonderful with some pasta.  This was so easy and delicious.  Think it will be my new basic white sauce.   Thank you so much for a great recipe",

I normally don't make alfredo since DH isn't fond of it, but I decided to whip this up last night (really-it takes just minutes!) and added some southwestern chicken bites.  DH kept commenting how great it was and had two hefty portions!  Thank you for turning him in favor of alfredo!  I did add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp salt and accidently added too much parmesan, but it really made no difference.  Yum!",

I had it with king prawn and some red and green peppers chopped very fine with riginette pasta it's a flat ribbon pasta with rippled edges to catch all that lovley sauce. When I have the girls round for lunch I am going to make this for them they will go nuts for it. Thanks for a great recipe Marg, next time I will get a picture.",

But I don't think that alters the recipe one bit.\n\nExcellent simple recipe and the best!  I prefer Fettuccini, but alfredo can go over anything and be good. Pasta is just up to your particular taste.  Anything works.\n\nThank you for a great traditional Alfredo Sauce!",

I had a couple of boxes of cream (heavy and whipping, I think) from other recipes feeling lonely in the 'fridge that I combined (stovetop) for this recipe.  Also, maybe was a litte heavy-handed on the parmesan, but who's complaining?!  Combined this with whole grain linguini, ground beef and broccoli ( http://www.recipezaar.com/Beef-Broccoli-and-Pasta-Alfredo-285213 ) for a delicious meal that my family loved.  Lovely recipe- thanks so much!",

I think the problem people have with blandness is that they are not using high quality cheese. I use freshly grated aged Locatelli pecorino romano, and it adds plenty of punch to this recipe without tweaking it at all. Plain old parmesan would definitely make for a bland sauce...buy high quality Italian cheese and see what a difference it makes :-)",

The sauce was a little too thin for my liking, so the only thing I did different was I added 1/2 TBSP of flour after some of the cheese had melted and mixed it in and microwaved it for about another minute and a half.  The sauce was not bland for me, but I used authentic Parmesan cheese.  Also, I did not need to add salt because the cheese made it salty enough for my taste.  Enjoy!!",

        "Review": "Really good!  Just a note to self.  NO added salt.  For some odd reason this came out quite salty, but probably my fault.  The real reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was that the overall consistency was very thin.  And for us, a thicker sauce for pasta is what is needed.  I'll definitely make it again but a bit thicker.  Thanks for posting!",

I used fresh parmesan cheese which makes a huge difference.  I posted a pic as well.  I'm making it again tomorrow for my boyfriends birthday.",

However it was very quick and simple to make which is great for a busy week night meal, so we may try others versions of this next time.  Thanks for a fast meal, without having to hit the dreaded drive through.",

Pasta (started first) finished cooking same time, tossed it in, gave it a good stir. On the table in 20 minutes, quick, easy and yummy. Other than the shrimp, the only thing I changed was I added garlic when cooking the shrimp, we love garlicky shrimp.",

        "Review": "Create a thick sauce without using flour or cornstarch. Instructions are from a site referring to Alfredo's original recipe. 1. Don't use cheap cheese, Parmigiano Reggiano is a good option for flavor. 2.Melt the butter in a sauce pan low heat to prevent separation. If it does, start over. 3.Slowly whisk in the cream and let simmer for about 1 -3 minute until mixture starts to thicken. The real thickening will occur with the addition of the cheese. 4.Add drained pasts to creamy, buttery mixture. 5. Remove from heat before adding the parmigiano to the Alfredo cream mixture and toss. Sauce will quickly thicken over time so wait at least 1 min before deciding to add more cheese to thicken. For thinner or thicker sauce adjust with amount of cheese but every time I follow these instructions the sauce is thick and sticks to the pasta. A pinch of fresh ground nutmeg gives subtle flavor.",

I think it would be easier to make it into a sealed taco, rather than a personal pot pie.",

The dough, if correctly made, is extremely tasty and flaky; I don't know why, but we call it \"Massa Podre\" (rotten dough).  (I don't recall only egg yolk in the dough, by the way.)  My grandmother used to make them all the time.  They are actually made in very small individual tins.  It's A LOT of work, since each individual tiny tin has to be buttered and then arranged on a cookie panto take them to the oven. People nowadays buy them already made, for parties.",

Also, it is most often made with cabbage rather than brussel sprouts, but any greens would be nice. The most important thing is to fry it long enough so that the edges go brown and crispy ! Yum !

I was also fortunate enough to have fresh brussels sprouts from the farmers market.  The wine vinegar I have is probably not the best.  It would probably be even better with a better quality vinegar.  I might even try it with balsamic....",

I actually need it to use for another recipe, but couldn't bear to buy one in the supermarket, full of E-numbers and other horrible things, when this is so easy to make. The only thing I found was that my baking time was less than is given here -- about 1 hour total. Perhaps this is because I am using a fan oven but in any case it pays to keep an eye on the cake and test periodically.",

I used a round cake tin and cooked it for an hour and ten minutes at 150C. It came out perfect. This is definitely one I'll be using often. Thanks for the recipe!",

That said, the finer you get the nuts the better the paste consistency.  Thanks Babara for a great recipe.",

        "Review": "I did not add the savory,snow peas,lemon or coconut. Just didn't have these on hand. Don't know that I would even use the coconut. BUT, what I did do is: Sautee the gr. onion, celery, ginger and fresh garlic in the 3 TBL butter. Added the chicken broth. Brought it to a boil then added sliced carrots the broccoli, mushrooms, oregano, marjoram, fresh basil and the rice. Brought that to a boil and then simmered for 20 minutes. Absolutely delicious! Next time I will add some slivered water chestnuts for some crunch. Yum!!",

        "Review": "You can tell by the recipe number that this has been on Zaar for a long time; I surprised that it hasn't been treid & reviewed by more chefs! Its a very easy & versatile recipe that gives great flavour to plain old boring brown rice. Due to lack of ingredients, I made the following substitutions: dried thyme for savory, powdered ginger for fresh, purple onion for green & lemon pepper for zest. I added dethawed frozen pea pods & broccoli florets once the celery & onions were tender. I'll repeat this recipe with different veggie combinations in the future. Thanx Robb!",

I mixed the milk, flour,  garlic powder, salt, pepper, and broccoli in a bowl first so they were well combined. Then I layered the potatoes, covered them with the milk mixture and sprinkled the cheese on top. I did this in 4 layers, keeping a little extra cheese for the top. I cooked them covered for the first hour then uncovered them to let the cheese crisp up. They were cooked to perfection, we really enjoyed them. Even my kids gobbled them up. Thanks, I will make these again :)",

I don't know if using the Yukons made a difference or not, but the recipe just didn't turn out for us.But, thank you for taking the time to \" Adopt \" an orphaned recipe. :)",

If making again I would add some crispy cooked bacon and some spring onion and would always use the paprika.  Also took 45 to cook at 175C fan forced oven (I had 3 layers of potatoes thinly sliced).  Thank you GrandmalsCooking.",

        "Review": "This being the first time I've had scalloped potatoes since I was a kid 20 years ago, I don't have a basis for comparison. However, aside from time-consuming preparation, these were easy to make, and were pretty tasty. Next time I would definitely add some kind of meat (bacon or ham) and some onions to jazz it up a little, but otherwise, I'd leave it as is. I had servings of it, and so did my boyfriend. I did take mine out of the oven after 1 hour and 20 minutes though as the tops were looking plenty crispy and the sample slice I pulled out of it was cooked through.",

As refrigerated biscuits are not available here in Singapore, I used thick whole-wheat bread cut into rounds with a wine glass. I tried making my own but the recipe didn't work out (it could be me though) and I had to throw the whole batch away. :( However, the recipe turned out very delicious, even with my funny 'crust'. And I made individual casserole so we can eat while we watch TV. :) Oh I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of Worchestershire sauce of too, together with the onions. Next time I will add some bell peppers too. Thanks!",

(3) The 15 min prep time listed is quite wrong...by the time I chopped the chicken, the broccoli, the onion, minced the garlic, grated the mozzarella, made the sauce ... well,you get the picture. It took me almost an hour to prepare. But it was well worth the effort and I will definitely make this again -- my family LOVED it.",

I like crunch more than moist and tender, so made it as specified through the browning of the chicken rolls ... then continued sauteeing on the stovetop for another half-hour/45 minutes..or so.

I used dried blueberries and used the juice from the lemon and powdered sugar to make a glaze for the scones.  They were wonderful!

        "Review": "Awesome and so easy!!!  I must confess I didn't make blueberry but I will next time, I didn't have a lemon.  So I made cranberry orange. I used up the dried cranberries in the pantry I didn't have exactly 1.5 cups so I did 1/4 cup raisins and 1/4 cup tropical fruit and 1 cup cranberries, I did the zest of an orange and I put in half of the orange cut into small pieces with all the skin off. They just came out and taste awesome!  I did use 1 Tbs extra sugar in them to make sure sweet enough for my taste! More sugar wouldn't hurt but tasted perfect.  Thank you for a recipe that looked simple so I wasn't scared to try them! It was my first time w/ scones.  I do not own one of those special mats I used my Airbake cookie sheet, half I sprayed w/ Pam and left the other half dry they came off just fine on both sides. We will be making again and I know my husband will be excited he has always hoped I would get into making scones!",

Mine looked nice and golden brown and so pretty...better than that photo...next time I'll take pics...I left out the zest because I didn't feel like dealing with it. Next time I'll do 2 things different. 1. I'll do the dry stuff with the butter in a food processor as I find it easier to cut in the butter this way. 2. I'll transfer the 6 inch square to the pan b4 I cut it and then cut. I found it very hard to transfer them to the baking pan. I'll cut and leave it in the square and then cut again when they come out of the oven. \r\nAll in all these were so good. The whole family loved them and I'll make them again and again. Maybe I'll try different berries too and I love the idea someone had to add white chocolate chips. Thank you so much for posting!",

I am eager to see how they are tomorrow.  Excellent recipe.  I will definitely make these again!  They are very tasty.  The reviews that say otherwise are most likely unfamiliar with scones in general.  If one is looking for the sweetness of a muffin, there are fabulous recipes for those.  If you know not to expect too much sugar in a scone, I believe you will enjoy this recipe!  Thanks, Mimi for sharing!",

Even though I followed the recipe exactly I had to knead in between 1/4 - 1/2 cup more flour before it quit sticking the the board and my hands. However, this recipe would probably work best with drier fruit and I do intend to try it again with apples.",

        "Review": "Light and tasty, but I felt they lacked flavor the first time I made them. Second time I upped the lemon zest, and a bit more sugar, not much though. For appearance I added some striped glaze to mine. That can be done simply by mixing milk or orange juice with confectioner's sugar to get a good consistency. This adds alot to the initial presentation of the scones. Finally I made 12 scones with this recipe, instead of 8; they feel more correctly sized that way, previously they were too big. Cheers!",

Placed the dough in a pie plate and patted it down with floured hands, brushed with cream and sprinkled with sugar and cut them into 8 servings and baked for about 25 minutes. Scones are a biscuit with fruit or other ingredients added. They are not supposed to be sweet as they are bread. I know we see them at all the coffee shops with tons of sugar and frosting on top but those are more like dessert.",

When the scones cooled they were fine, but quite a bit of blueberry was left on the parchment paper. I agree w/Chef Swifticus suggestion to up the lemon zest &amp; sugar. I added lemon glaze to the top of my batch.",

I can imagine that it would be a nice addition to the recipe.  I also didn't chill the mix as I'd used frozen blueberries and the mixture seemed firm enough.  It made almost 3 dozen and probably would have if I'd sampled less as I was putting them on the tray!  Thanks!",

        "Review": "This is one amazing carrot cake!!! I made it in preparation for an upcoming birthday ; ) and took some in to the office today to test drive it. It was gone in a flash, to rave reviews! Since i like my cakes a little less sweet I cut back the sugar to 1/12 cups in the cake, and also cut the oil back to 1 1/4 cups. In addition I only used about 3/4 of a box of powdered sugar in the frosting, and also used neufchatel cheese instead of regular cream cheese. It still came out superb! This will definitely become one of my \"standby\" cake recipes.",

        "Review": "I think I looked at every single recipe for carrot cake on this site, and narrowed it down to 4, in an effort to find one like my Mother used to make - then narrowed it to 2, - I chose this one over one that was almost identical, except this one used more flour, both had the exact same amount of oil (the other just seemed like it would be tooooo greasy!).  I have to say your recipe is perfection.  I made this for a baby's first birthday and used part of the batter in a little 6 inch pan for the baby (so she could maul it, which she did and it was adorable) - and put the remainder in a standard tube pan for the adults.  I had omitted the nuts because of the baby, but topped the large cake with toasted pecans. Everyone raved about it, and had 2nds.  People love to add all kinds of things to carrot cake (raisins, pineapple etc), and those are ok - but I really prefer the elegance and texture of your recipe.  I grated the carrots by hand (I really wish I owned a food processor), on the tiny tiny side, so basically had pulp - it works out to be about 3 heaping cups, if anyone needs that as comparison.  The texture of the cake was like velvet, very moist but not heavy, as this type of cake can be.  Obviously I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed it.  Thanks so much for posting it, and I'm sure I'll never again use any other carrot cake recipe... oh one more thing, this recipe is super easy and I think even a novice baker would have success.  The only thing that took any time at all, was grating the carrots, and if you have a food processor, that would only take a few minutes.  Ok, I'll shut up now, thanks again.",

        "Review": "Well, I took this to Thanksgiving dinner.  It got TOP ratings from the family-- fantastic, amazing, phenomenal, and \"damn good.\"  This was not hard to make.  I only have a small processor, so I used it for the carrots, then a hand blender for the rest.  I didn't use the optional garnish, so it wasn't terribly decorative, but nobody cared.  I might add some nuts into the crust next time, pecans maybe.  Thanks a lot Cindy!",

I got rave reviews and lots of compliments on this and when I finally grabbed a piece, I could see what they were talking about.  It was amazing!  I did chop some nuts in the blender and add them to the crust before making it.  Truly enjoyed!",

Next time I'll know to double up on the receipe.  I used mandarin oranges as the garnish.  It looked and tasted wonderful.  Thank you so much for the wonderful receipe!  \r\n\r\nDevon from PA",

I made this punch twice for Christmas gatherings using $4.50 a bottle champagne (or more correctly, sparkling wine) on sale, and liked it so much, it will be my go-to punch recipe from now on.  Along with its other attributes, men and women alike enjoyed it.  Thank you, polar-express, for this classic recipe!  Lynnie",

I served it at a 'Baby Shower' in both the regular version as well as a non-alcoholic version where I substitued the champagne with Martinelli's Sparkling Cider (I think you could use 7-Up too).  Both versions were a HUGE hit and everyone wanted the recipee.  Thank you!",

I wanted to use the pineapple concentrate instead of the limeade, but when I went to the store, I couldn't find the pineapple frozen concentrate. So I bought Dole Pineapple Juice instead (in the juice aisle) and used about 1/2 to 3/4 of the 46 fl. oz. can. It was perfect! We floated sliced limes on top for added color and interest. Note: You will need a larger punch bowl for this recipe.",

Every time I serve it, it disappears very quickly, and I make a double batch. One year I tried it in a fountain. It doesn't work until all the bubbles disappear from the champagne and the ginger ale. I make an ice ring with cranberries and/or strawberries in it, one half green, one half red. You won't regret making this one.",

I used a bottle of light minute maid orange juice, a can of Welch's light frozen cranberry juice concentrate, 1 pack of crystal lite lemonade powder (2 quart size), 1/2 pack of crystal lite mango powder, 2L of diet ginger-ale and a bottle of champagne (no water). I mixed all the juices and drink mixes ahead of time and then mixed in the ginger-ale right before serving and added the champagne without stirring. It turned out perfect! It was just sweet enough to taste good, but not so much that you get tired of drinking it. My guests loved it!",

I used 4 egg whites and 1 whole egg, added one extra banana and cut down on the butter a little bit because of it, used 2/3 cup of Amaretto and omitted the almonds because I didn't have any on hand.  Even with my substitutions the cake still came out so moist and perfect!  To make a glaze I boiled 1/4 cup sugar and 1/8 water with some almond extraxt and then poured it over the hot cake; it gave it a nice crispy, sugary glaze on top.  The only change I'll make next time is to let it sit for a day before serving because I found the almond flvouring really came through when I had a piece a day later instead of the day it was made.  I think this will definitely become a family favourite!",

I'd already used all the ingredients in the cake, and hadn't set aside anything to use to make a glaze. While it smelled fabulous while baking, and had a moist, dense texture, the flavor didn't measure up. I did substitue unsalted butter for the margarine, and generic almonds instead of Dole brand (but I would think the butter would have made it better, not worse). I did make my own glaze, which was fine, but it really didn't help the cake.",

It is lovely and sweet enough without any icing or glaze. This cake has a fine crumb and is very moist. I subbed out the almonds and almond liqueur/extract for banana liqueur, vanilla and a drop of orange extract; and added 1/4 or so cup of wheat germ. Like another reviewer I used Crisco... it was what I had on hand. Took the full 50 minutes in my oven. Just a lovely cake.",

        "Review": "We did enjoy the taste of this very much, we were just not quite sure how to eat it!  In the end we picked it up and made a very tasty mess!!  The taste is outstanding , we love the mix of balsamic vinegar and EVO oil, of course the garlic was great as were the rosemary and parsley.  Also loved the crusty cheese toast under it.  All in all it was almost too much of a good thing, almost an overpowering taste. We probably will make it again but would cut back on almost everything, except the cheese and bread. Thanks for sharing a good brushetta.",

Had some nice smoked provolone, so used that.  Ate it with a knife and fork-wonderful, fresh, summer-like sandwich!!",

I used Granny Smiths, but will use a less tart apple next time. Did get very mixed reviews on this, sharply divided between sweet-eaters versus non-sweet-eaters. The people who love cookies and candy didn't like it. The people who don't eat sweets loved it! I will make it again for the family because the regulars thought it was great. \r\nThanks!",

I used Lawry's \"Prefect Blend\" for Poultry seasoning rather than the Tony Chachere's, added some green peas and thickened the broth/gravy with some instant potatoes.  Cooked on low for 6 hours, took the chicken off the bones and served over mashed potatoes.  Really yummy, almost like a Chicken A La King.",

Added some corn starch to thicken the liquid up some.  Tossed the chicken, some fresh veggies, and the broth back into the crock.  I didnt have any cream or sour cream so i added a bit of yogurt.  Served over mashed taters but would be good with rice or alone.",

But I followed your recipe as close as I could and made a big pot full of moist tasty shredded chicken.(froze most for later use) My husband was impressed! I used six frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I used all the veggies in your recipe with the exception of the green onion. I had a white one on hand. and I didn't have cajun seasoning so I used what I had. Turned out Fabulous!",

        "Review": "I really enjoyed this recipe.  Since I cook for just myself, a whole chicken would be just too much chicken for me and so I used two boneless-skinless chicken breasts.  Also, I used a yellow onion (chopped) instead of green onions and a red bell pepper because I prefer red to green bell peppers.  I will definitely use this recipe again with just one minor change:  I think chicken broth will work better for me instead of water because of the small amount of chicken I cook, i.e., two boneless-skinless breasts vs. a whole chicken.  Thank you for posting this easy recipe â€“ it was so nice to come home to cooked chicken that was ready to go.",

        "Review": "Sourdough bread is bread made without added yeast. By making a \"starter\" in which wild yeast can grow, the sourdough baker can raise bread naturally, as mankind did for thousands and thousands of years before a packet of yeast was an available convenience at the local market. Not all sourdough is sour-tasting; Amish Friendship Bread and other types of live-yeast breads are also sourdough.\r\n\r\nTo become a sourdough baker, all you need are some basic ingredients (flour, water, salt, and sugar), some basic tools (a mixing bowl, an oven, and a baking sheet), and a basic interest. If you can make bread, you can make sourdough bread.",

That way I end up with half as much batter; then I cook two loaves and have the other half to keep as starter for my next batch of bread. My friends are not big on baking so this way I did not have to scramble to get rid of the starter each time.",

Omitting the cinnamon, I have made using chocolate with 1 cup choc. chips.  It's probably my family's favorite.  I've also done pumpkin, cranberry, strawberry, pistachio, vanilla, and butterscotch with butterscotch chips.  The only variety I haven't liked has been the pistacio.  Next I'm planning on trying it lemon or Chocolate with peanut butter chips.  This is such a great versitile recipe!",

I have made lots of variations and usually make them as muffins.  I take muffins to let people know that I am thinking of them.  I usually make several batches and keep some in the freezer so they are handy if I need them.  My family loves them for breakfast or a quick snack.  Some of the variations have been lemon (omit cinnamon and use lemon pudding), peanut butter (add 1 cup of peanut butter cut in the dry ingredients and omit cinnamon),etc.  It also makes a great bundt cake that is like a coffee cake.  It says that you can't put it in the fridge, but I keep bags of the starter in the bottom of my refrigerator so that I can bake when I want - just bring them out for a day ( or at least to room temperature) Everyone loves this recipe and looks forward to a plate.",

When it was time to bake the bread, I froze the two starters you are supposed to give to friends.  In place of the 1 cup of oil, I used applesauce, with no problems.  I have also substituted different flour combinations: white, whole wheat, whole wheat pastry, golden white.  Our favorite has been half golden white and half whole wheat.  I have also used sugar-free vanilla pudding and liked that just as much.  The starters that I froze taste just as good as the \"fresh\" ones. Everyone I have made this for loves it!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!",

My Daughter came in from out of state with a starter mix from a friend and we baked hers using wheat flour and FF milk.  It is in the oven now so not sure how the substitute will be, but if it flops I can now get some more started for her.  Thanks again.",

        "Review": "@ rnmommy02 - you need air to get to it to allow wild yeast to grow in your starter, and then it's going to produce gas and ferment.  Keeping it in a closed container will likely reuslt in your bag exploding.  Try a mason or 1/2 gallon pickle jar with a dish towel draped over it.",

I also used regular sour cream for more flavor and a creamier texture. \r\n\r\nThe soup tasted better to me the second day. I would suggest chilling it overnight instead of the 8 hours because it gives the soup more time for the flavors to marinate together, thus bringing out the full flavor of the soup.",

        "Review": "I am sorry, but I did not like this soup at all, tried one serving and threw the rest out.  I think it was probably just my personal tastes, I think the nonfat sour cream gave it a weird flavor.  I really really wanted to like this, as we had such a good supply of cucumbers from the garden.  If I try this again, I will use low fat sour cream, and I will change my rating then if it improves.",

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added salt, cayenne, garlic, worcestershire, more lemon and chilled it overnight. I also added more fresh herbs and sour cream (Knudsen's makes a very good nonfat version). It was a different kind of soup and quite good. The sour cream really makes it.",

We found the soup to be rather bland, and even after I added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce, and a Dash (1/8 tsp each) of cayenne red pepper, garlic powder, and salt, (as others have suggested to add to the soup) we still didn't care for it. Sorry the soup didn't suit our taste buds, but I am glad to see others here have enjoyed the soup.",

        "Review": "I gave this recipe 4 stars. This is very good it's the first time I've had a cold cucumber soup. I made this recipe for my Culinary class. I made a few changes to the recipe. I cut the recipe in half. We didn't have sour cream so I used Culinary Cream, no dill so I had to leave it out and no lemons so that to had to be left out. My teacher had me cook my cucumber a bit before pureeing them. I cooked the cucumber in the chicken broth with the onion, parsley and white pepper. I did also add 1 minced garlic clove. I didn't chill this for the required 8 hours maybe 2-3 hours at most and it was very good. I did try this warm and it's much better cold. Overall I'd make this again! Thank you for posting a good recipe! Christine (internetnut)",

        "Review": "Before serving a soup I added 2 tablespoons of heavy cream, and beat it a little. It gives not only a richer flavor, but also an airy lightness to the soup. But still the soup was too plain as it&#039;s said in other reviews above, so the next time I made this soup I added 1 tablespoon more lemon juice and 1 mild-cured cucumber pureed together with fresh cucumbers. And poured just 2 tablespoons of water instead of 1 cup broth. Finally, I added cubes of toasted garlic rye bread like it shows in my photo.  These ingredients were added from another similar recipe and I don&#039;t regret it. For these small recipe improvements, I&#039;d give all five stars. Excellent!",

And of course we used Vegistock instead of chicken. I also only used 1/4cup of cilantro, ACCIDENTLY left out butter, olive oil instead of peanut and left out the raisins and garnish... and it was AMAZING!!! We used powdered spices insteaded making it fresh, but holy moly... SO SO SO good... even Vegan!! We were drooooling! KUDOS!",

        "Review": "My daughter and I really enjoyed this.  It had great complexity of flavor without being too spicy.\n\nTo cut down the time requirements, I used ground spices.  I also used some more chicken stock (1 14.5 oz can) and 3 cups of frozen mixed veg so I wouldn't have to make a side dish.",

        "Review": "This is a WONDERFUL recipe.  The spices are so well-balanced - it tastes delightful.\n\nI'm vegan and my fiance is a veggie-loving omnivore, so I used just one small chicken breast for him with about 1/4 of the spices and used the rest to cook up some potatoes, chickpeas, and peas for both us to enjoy.  Instead of chicken stock, I used some \"not chicken\" bouillon cubes I had on hand with a bit of water.\n\nAbsolutely worth the time, and the leftovers are even more flavorful.",

        "Review": "Confused about the 1 chicken breast listed in this. The chicken breast would have to be huge to even fit inside of the measurements laid out. (12*17)\nI would figure you would shred the chicken and spread with the vegetables to make it stretch. But I couldn't imagine feeding my family of 6 with 1 chicken breast. It would make a lot of dough though.\nMaybe this would be better if you shredded the chicken and mixed with vegetables, then laid it down the middle and \"mock\" braided it. I would also increase the chicken to 2 pieces if done this way at the very least.",

I did make just a little revision since we always have a big crowd. I doubled the recipe and added to the filling: 2 Tbs Grated Parmesan Cheese and 2 cans of well drained Crabmeat. This filled 2-12oz pkgs of mushroom caps. Thanks for the great recipe!!",

With all of the food I was serving, it was nice to have a \"lighter\" appetizer vs the typical sausage and cheese stuffing.  Quick and easy, and the house smelled great while they were cooking.  I doubled the recipe and only had 3 or 4 left over.  A definite repeat!",

Both my husband and I devoured these.  I used an 8 oz package of cremini mushrooms, which we thought were great, but don't know if there might be better ones to choose from?  I cooked them for about 10 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Agree with others that this is a great light-tasting recipe.  Will definitely repeat!",

I used just under 8 oz of mushrooms, but left out the celery (don't care for it), used green onions, used parmesan flavored breadcrumbs, and sauteed in olive oil, rather than butter.  Baked for 7 minutes at 400 degrees.  They were delicious, but a bit salty (probably the parmesan).  So easy and delicious!",

        "Review": "These are fabulous, reminds me of Almond Rocca LOL. Though it was a bit crumbly. I realized there's no need to chill the dough for they stayed in shape while baking.  They're done in 15min UPDATE: i've added 1/2t for the remaining 5 cookies (as suggested by SUDIKA) but i didn't taste anything diff as compared to the plain ones. Again, great crunchy cookies! UPDATE AGAIN: 3rd time i made these, doubled the recipe and still works great!",

Every one of our Veterans would have heart failure to hear that cocoa and chocolate topping were being put in ANZAC bikkies.  Just leave them as is - it's the only <b>respectful</b> way to enjoy them.",

This recipe unfortunately didn't help me much - it was too dry, I ended up doubling (at least) the water - it would have been too crumbly otherwise. other recipes I have tried had a bit more colour and flavour due to an increase of Golden Syrup and the use of brown sugar instead of white.",

They didn't look like they were going to spread on their own after a few minutes in the oven, so I squashed them down with a fork.  Just thought I should say that, in case people don't know what they're supposed to look like!  :)",

Anzacs are normally quite flat, and crispy - almost snappy.   The old Women's Weekly version is probably the classic I am remembering so we will stick to that recipe for our family.  However, for an oaty bulky bikky this is delicious.",

I added a bit more water and golden syrup but i was not thrilled with the consistency of the dough and had to press it together to make my tablespoons not be all crumbs. I baked as directed and I got a tasty biscuit/cookie but not what I expected. I showed them to a friend in AU who said it was wrong and pulled up several recipes for me...all similar but they mostly used a full cup brown sugar, a full cup coconut, 2 T of golden syrup and 1t of baking soda. The dough moister and the brown sugar allowed for a better spreading of the cookie - the first did not spread at all.\n\nThe golden syrup I was prepared to have to substitute for and instead found it rather easily here in Florida! However the unsweetened coconut was the challenge to my surprise and finally found it in a health food shop. They didn't know what dessicated was but that is exactly what they were selling.\n**OK, must be me so I upped the stars. With changes based on other similar recipes still very crumbly and not what I expected..so must just be me. Like I said..tasty no matter what!",

Allow for spreading room as they do grow in the oven.  These need to be cooled before removing from the baking tray as they are soft and will break.  These are very crunchy and my kids love the texture and the loud crunch they deliver.  An Aussie classic that has been eaten by members of my family for 5 generations as my great grandfather was in the light horse brigade in WW1 and now my kids eat them too.",

I used ground pork instead of ground beef, since I'm trying to reduce the amount of beef we eat.  I added green beans, carrots and mushrooms, as an extra layer between the meat which I split into two layers.<br/><br/>I thought it was a bit strange to just put the canned tomatoes on top, but it totally worked.  They and the peppers in the second last layer baked into a delicious sort of crust.",

The only change I made was I used Cheddar Jack cheese in place of the Swiss cheese and as part of the Mozzarella.  This dish was delicious to say the least! Excellent choice. If you love pot pie and you love lasagna, this is the recipe for you! Comfort at its best. It's going into my recipe folder right now! Thanks so much for sharing Libby. Karen",

The kids chowed down on theirs and ate in silence, which means they are too busy eating and liking it to talk!  I did made a few changes for our tastes.  I didn't use the red pepper, and I used Cheddar cheese instead of Swiss, as I'm not crazy about Swiss cheese.  Other than that made like the recipe.  We will have again cause when the kids like something, I make it often!",

        "Review": "This was a very good and original recipe.  We did not use any ricotta cheese, only because no one in my family really cares for it, so we used extra mozzarella and cheddar cheese (no swiss).  I left out the peas and thyme b/c in the directions it was left out so I just forgot about those ingredients and it still turned out well, although next time I want to definitely add the peas.  When I sauteed the chicken initially, I coated it in some montreal chicken seasoning to add another layer of flavor and I'm glad I did or I think it would have been missing something.  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the carrots, mushrooms and onion.  Use chicken broth instead of sherry b/c I didn't have any on hand.  Definitely a keeper and one you can play around with to suit your own tastes!!",

Also added a dash of garlic powder:) Corn flake crumbs worked well. I think next time I will try using a box of crushed up dry stuffing mix with the seasonings in it(like Stove Top) for the coating, as I think the seasonings would kick up the flavor even more (although they really don't need it!) Sprinkled the tops of the rolls with a little parsley, and served them with mashed potatoes, gravy, and corn on the cob. My whole family went wild over it!! I will DEFINITELY be making these again...and again...and again! I did have a little filling left over, which I didn't mind because it makes a great sandwich filling!!",

I tweaked the sauce a bit by upping the cayenne and ginger, and adding some turmeric (my naturopath recommended adding it to my diet). Chicken took about 10 minutes per side to broil, and I finished it up by brushing it with a bit of the sauce and putting it back under the broiler for a bit. Really delicious and easy! Plus I loved that the sauce was mostly raw, used real peanuts instead of butter. The less processed foods we eat, the better! ",

I ended up adding a bit of sesame oil and played with it a bit, but it never really played out the way I hoped.",

I used an extra egg (although we didn't measure out the meat exactly, so maybe we had a little more than a pound) and no butter, but it was still very tender and moist.  Next time we'll have to get a sweet dipping sauce (only thing around was ketchup)!  Thanks!",

        "Review": "An exceptionally tasty - and different - recipe! My family gobbled it up for dinner tonight. I had trouble getting the chicken to brown like I wanted (perhaps because I sprayed it with olive oil in a Misto sprayer instead of drizzling with butter), so I ended up cooking it a bit longer, resulting in slightly-too-dry chicken tenders. This was purely my fault, though. For the sauce, I used a sauce intended for coconut shrimp that uses orange marmalade, dijon mustard, and honey, from recipe # 9061. Simply heavenly with the chicken! This dish is really similar in taste to the Outback's coconut shrimp (except it's chicken!) I love that you can bake it instead of frying it! My husband raved! A definite keeper!",

VERY tasty.  ***ONE WORD OF WARNING:  I followed the recipe to the letter, but found that my electric oven at 400 degrees began to burn (not toast) the coconut within three minutes...I reduced the heat to 325 and cooked for the remaining time called for in the recipe...the chicken turned out juicy and the crust was delicious.  My version of dipping sauce may not be to everyone's taste, but if you like a combo of sweet and tangy, then I would highly recommend it. ",

This chicken is spectacular. It came out fork-tender and perfectly done. The only criticism I have is that the coconut wasn't really browned to my liking by the time the chicken was done, but this was easily remedied by about a minute under the broiler. This dish is easily worth five stars.",

Since chicken is cut up, it should cook in less time. If you do a 400 F and 25 mins, you will get an over cooked and burnt chicken bites. If you want the chicken bits to brown nicely, try to use mince chicken, and add in shredded coconut, shape it into nugget size, and then dip in egg and flour (panko works very well).",

I got a bit confused with the double cocoa and double sugar quantities listed in the recipe, so the cake got all of them.  I also used very heaped spoons of cocoa as someone else had mentioned it could be a bit more chocolatey.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a delicious and easy chocolate cake recipe.",

I think it had good flavor (I used fresh basil and white onion), but I'm sorry I can't say it was outstanding.  I was hoping for a bit more liquid, which I didn't get, and it definitely needed a little more salt and pepper at the end.  I did add the butter, but it would have been better with more sauce.  Adding chicken broth to make a sauce might be a big help.  Also, for a novice cook the recipe might be hard to figure out, as it gives no cook time for the chicken, nor does it say when to add the garlic. ",

The date amount was dropped to between 2 and 3 ozs and they were not boiled but chopped and added. The cola became Diet Cherry Vanilla Coke and it was used cold. The brown sugar became 1/3 cup of Splenda.The extracts were 1/2 tsp each of vanilla and cherry and I skipped the nuts. Even with these changes it's wonderful in flavor and light and very tender inside. I will use an 8x4\" pan next time I make this as it didn't get very high in the 9x5 I used. I find it plenty sweet enough with the drastic cut in the dates and sugar. I don't even want to imagine how sweet it would be in the original form. This is easy to put together and bakes up a to a very nice color. My DH came following his nose for the second time today asking what was baking.",

Be sure to use fresh marshmellows.  One time I made it with an older package & it didn't work out well.  Enjoy!!!",

You could turn the gravy portion of this recipe into a creamy homemade gravy recipe with different flavorings such as beef or chicken soup base mix added to the flour. I served it with buttered carrots and mashed potatoes, made with butter and cream and kosher salt, and whipped until creamy in my KitchenAid mixer(preheat the bowl with hot water before adding the cooked potatoes). Yum.",

I used fresh roasted green chile as opposed to the canned kind, and my kids do not like chiles, so I filled half of the muffin pan with the batter prior to adding the chiles.  The ones w/o chile were dry, but ok.  I think next time I will add a little corn to thier half.  Will absolutely make these again!",

        "Review": "Ah, my friends, this is the scone of my dreams. The perfect texture -  a nice combo of flaky yet sturdy. The dough is marvelous, the perfect ratio of dry and wet ingredients. It comes out easy to work with, not too sticky and a joy to knead. I'm so glad there is vanilla in the recipe, it made them smell heavenly while baking and the vanilla and raisin flavors are fabulous! My only recommendations are to be sure and knead the dough a bit after adding the raisins (in step 5) before patting on your board. Also, I only got 7 scones out of the dough and I used every bit of it. I give this recipe an A plus and 2 thumbs up! You gotta try it with stawberry preserves and Devon cream. The best! I'm uploading a picture, too.",

They were quite easy to put together and though I'm certain I overworked the dough a bit, the scones were still tender and moist with a nice crispness on the shell. I added zest from one orange to the dough then split the dough in three. Made plain scones with one third; added dried cranberries to one-third; and, currants to the last third. Brought them into the office where they were quickly consumed by the crowd.  Even colleagues who ussually don't eat baked goods tried them and loved 'em. Thanks. ",

To make this in a loaf pan, just press the dough into the pan gently, cook for about 15 minutes tented with foil, and then cook another 5 minutes without the foil.",

        "Review": "These scones are delicious! I have tried at least two other scone recipes (Betty Crocker and Joy of Cooking, I think--oh! and another from the Internet, so three) and this one is the best. I think it might be a little too sweet for my mom--she says they taste a bit like sugar cookies. This is definitely true. But they are so good with strawberry jam. I only wish I had clotted cream to put on them as well. I've got a batch in the kitchen ready to eat and am already excited for breakfast tomorrow morning! I made a double batch and got 29 total scones.",

        "Review": "I have not made this exact recipe but it is essentially the same as what is called \"boiled raisin cake\", which I have made, and it's delicious. When it first came out of the oven I thought I'd really done something wrong because it felt very, very firm to the touch and I thought it would be hard and dry. I let it sit for a day and it didn't seem any better, so I covered it with frosting and voila, the third day it was moist, dense and delicious, the kind of thing you can't resist taking a chunk of every time you pass the pan sitting on the counter. So the moral is to get it frosted right away and let it mellow for a day, then dig in. I used a vegan \"cream cheese \"frosting and it was delicious. The caramel frosting above sounds even better. Since shortening is baaaaad stuff, I used non-hydrogenated vegan margarine in the cake. You could also use canola oil. Great cake.",

I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil (not to much)! I would also add about 1 1/2 tbls more of vineger. (or to taste) add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.",

As said in earlier posts, I would definitely only recommend using 1 Tbsp. of the chili sauce instead of 2 Tbsp.  Also, only 4 Tbsp. of the corn starch is needed.  Otherwise, it'll congeal pretty quickly.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone seeking \"the real thing.\"",

I doubled the amount of soy, vinegar and sesame oil.  I also increased the egg and tofu amount a tiny bit (b/c I excluded the yolks in half the eggs I used and I love tofu).

I used 4 eggs, but next time I'll use two.  The vegetables can be varied at will.  I used Golden Needles, but no fungus and regular mushrooms instead of the straw.  We did not care for water chestnuts in the soup and I wouldn't use them next time.  And there WILL be a next time, because I am now done looking for the Hot and Sour Soup of my dreams.",

And I've tried to make it from scratch several times unsuccessfully.  This recipe was easy and the ultimate Hot & Sour soup.  I will never look further for a recipe.  The changes I made were to use 1.5 tbsp of chili paste (I like spice but would reduce further if not used to it), 2 eggs and 3 tbsp of cornstarch, no pork, no straw mushrooms and substituted dried porcini mushrooms for the dried black fungus. Next time I'd try to find the dried black fungus and cut the water chestnuts into smaller pieces. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.   ",

I'm not much of a cook so I just went through the comments and modified the recipe to my liking based on what others said. I was very impressed with the way it turned out, will make often.",

        "Review": "Wonderful recipe with the modifications others have suggested (less chili paste, cornstarch, egg; a slight bit more vinegar - I used rice vinegar. I also reduced the soy sauce to 1 T). Also, to make things even easier, I use canned straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and baby corn, and reconstituted shiitake mushrooms. I also omitted the pork and water chestnuts. If I have more time, I like to add the black fungus, and tiger lily buds (golden needles). ",

I only used 1 egg and didn't have any dried black fungus.  I also used about 8 oz of tofu and that was plenty for us.  My husband and son were so impressed, they figured the local Chinese restaurant could use me for a chef. Thanks for posting!",

That was just the right amount of heat for us. 1 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch was perfect. Did use about 1/2 tsp. of pepper but will omit it next time. The bite was harsh. I will also omit the egg. I don't believe it adds to the flavor and the broth would be much more appealing to the eye without it. Did garnish with chopped Cilantro. It added a nice flavor and additional color.",

Used more broth and less cornstarch.  Added cilantro, bean sprouts, half the chili paste, and used regular mushrooms instead of straw mushrooms.  Next time I think I will make it thicker and possibly add noodles in place of tofu.  My fiance is already begging me to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe Nancy!",

This year was so successful.  My sons thought the soup was divine!  Everyone raved over it.  We did add the left-over pork filling from the egg rolls to it, as we did not want to waste anything.  It actually gave some additional texture and color, with the grated carrots.  We did not use 4 eggs, but cut that amount in half.  Also, we substituted the red chile paste with cayenne pepper.  All of it tasted better than any restaurant we have been to in the USA and abroad.  Thanks again for the great and  fairly quick recipe.",

It tastes just like the hot and sour soup I have been craving, but can't have in the UK b/c we can't afford to eat out.  \r\n\r\nI left out the pork, eggs, carrot, water chestnut, and black fungus.  It was delicious.  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and did not find the soup thick at all.\r\n\r\nNext time I'll try to find golden needles and black fungus, and then maybe open a Chinese restaurant!  \r\n\r\nThanks for a great recipe that I'll be sharing with family and friends!",

I really like the restaurant version of hot & sour soup, and this had a little different taste, but VERY close! I think the ingredients that threw the flavor off was the mushrooms. I used canned shiitake & straw mushroom (only way I could find them) and was not impress with the flavor & texture it gave. Next attempt will be with fresh button mushrooms...which I've had at a couple Chinese restaurants. Thanks so much!!",

Relying on some of the other reviews, I used only 1 tsp. of cornstarch and 1 tbsp. of garlic chili paste, and when taste-testing it was not spicy enough (my family likes strong taste) so I ended up using 2 tbsp paste as the recipe said.  I also increased the soy to 3 tbsp and used 1/3 cup rice vinegar in place of 1/4 cup white vinegar.  I also used low-sodium soy sauce, which worked fine.  This was wonderful, flavorful and very authentic-tasting.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I would back off on the vinegar but I can't think of any other way to improve this recipe. It was just plain awful! I will pay $1 for a cup of awesome authentic hot & sour at my local Chinese restaurant from now on.",

The recipe has been passed out numerous times. It is the BEST hot and sour soup I have ever had and that includes in Chinese restaurants.  It is my go to recipe, period. \r\nWe like it hot so I used 3 tablespoons of the garlic/chili sauce. I omitted the carrots and used 2 beaten eggs instead of the more healthy egg substitute. Regarding the cornstarch, I just keep adding the slurry until it looks to be the right consistency.  Everything else is as the recipe recommends....including the black fungus...or wood ear mushrooms. \r\nThanks so much, Nancy.",

I didn't see where it said to add the carrots so I put them in with the bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts.   I used 1 T  garlic red chili sauce, 1/4 c. egg substitute and only had button mushrooms and dried shitake and  also no tofu.   This is one dynamite hot and sour soup.

        "Review": "This was without a doubt THE most delicious, moist, tender pork loin I have ever eaten.  I didn't know what to expect but I picked about 6 valencia oranges & 2 meyer lemons from my garden & went to town.  I didn't have the peppers on hand so I used 1 teaspoon each of ground chile arbol & ground new mexico medium heat chili.  It was still missing a little something so I tossed in about 3 tablespoons of chicken base as the sauce reduced.  Cooked for about an hour at 350, spooning a little of the sauce over the roast every 15 minutes & was very pleasantly surprised!  This was even better than Claim Jumper folks.  What little was left was saved for later, I was going to give the doggies a little treat as there wasn't much but my honeybunny barred the door and said he wanted to take it to work tomorrow.  It was that good.  Do try it, you'll like it!",

At one hour the pork read at about 142 degrees.  I don't think you would want to cook them much longer than that or they would dry out.  Sooo gooood!!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe..it's a keeper!",

Halved vinegar ( as per other reviews advice) and ended up doubling sugar as it needed more to my taste, Also added 2 red chillies chopped up. 1/2 quantity made 2 jars. Everyone really liked it with Pork Loin chops.",

Less cinnamon could be used and to thicken at the end, try 1 Tbsp of corn starch or tapioca starch dissolved in a little water. A chopped up chili added at the beginning with the garlic, ginger and onion would give it a little pzazz.",

I am wondering if the typeof plums used made any difference, The only thing i can think of is the skins on the plums maybe made the sauce more sour. The plums here in nova scotia are quite sour at times. they were so ripe however they fell apart in my hands when pitting them. EXCLUDE the vinegar, and add double the sugar. Base the sugar and vinegar amounts on the sourness/sweetness of the first plum mixture.",

I was anticipating that they might fall apart in the frying but they stayed together without incident.  Added a little white pepper and dried shitake mushrooms to the broth.  One thing I would change for next time is adding less cornstarch as the gravy was a little too thick with the entire amount listed.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe; will definitely make this again.

        "Review": "This salad is absolutely awesome. I cut the recipe in half as I am the only one in my family that eats cranberries and I wanted to serve it with my Thanksgiving meal. Well I thought I was the only one but my family decided to give it a try and it was gone before we were finished with dinner. Wonderful side salad. Will be serving this again this Christmas only making a full batch. Thank you!",

        "Review": "Wonderful and yummy fruit salad!  We really like cool fruit salads with summer and holiday meals.  I get cranberries through the winter and freeze them to use all year, so this is a fun salad to take to summer picinics when the tart of cranberries isn't generally avaliable. It has become a staple at Thanksgiving or Christmas dinners.  I used Cool Whip instead of the cream to save on the calories.  Also, I generally don't care for marshmallows in recipes, but they were moist rather than dusty in this and very good. ",

I omitted the apples & salt and used a full pound of marshmallows, 1 cup of grapes & 3/4 cup of pecans (in place of the walnuts).  The taste is phenomenal!  So rich & delicious!!  I served it for our Christmas Eve buffet and then again with our Christmas Day brunch & then snacked on it for the next couple of days!  (increasing the amount of marshmallows really makes this into a gigantic salad)",

I made a few adjustments such as, I used 1 cup Splenda and 1 1/4 c sugar, I used 3/4 c canol oil instead of butter and 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of walnuts. For a frosting, I used 1/2 can of chocolate frosting beat with 1/2 pkg of cream cheese. I didn't have round pans so used two 9\"x13\" pans instead. I made it for a family dinner and baked and froze them three days ahead of time. On the day of the dinner I defrosted one and frosted it. It was absolutely fantastic. Rich and moist. The kids didn't have any idea there was zucchini in it, they just knew it was great and ate it up! Thank you for this wonderful recipe.",

        "Review": "When I saw this recipe, I thought, hmmm, I can easily make this nonfat, no cholesterol from a special diet person, so you'll have to forgive me for fiddling so much with this recipe.  I'm sure the original is better, but this is what I did, I used 6 egg whites, instaed of whole eggs a cup of applesauce, in place of oil,a cup and a half of sugar, one cup of whole wheat flour, one and a half cups regular flour, everything else the same. The batter smells great, must be the cocoa-cinnamon combo, smelled great cooking too, now smells great sitting on the counter.  When I saw the batter, I decided to put it in a 9x13 pan, to make one large cake.  The result was great, even with all of these changes.  It made what my mother would call a 'snack cake', perfect for breakfast, really good consistancy and taste.  I'm going to go have a piece now.  Great recipe, it's one I will make often, and so easy.",

Put a little icing on the muffins and the kids thought they were eating cupcakes!! Very rich and yummy...maybe a little on the dry side for me but I squeezed some of the water out of the shredded zucchini which I won't do next time. The cocoa and cinnamon are a delicious combo. Will definately make again!",

        "Review": "The little hunk of bread pictured with the chocolate and zucchinis is the last of two large loaves after one day in a family of 5.  The chocolate taste shines and the zucchini adds moistness and a slight chewy texture (but not rubbery).  The bread rose well and the finished loaf was light and airy for a quick bread. I reduced the sugar and oil by 1/4 cup each for high altitude adjustment.",

After I spread the mix in the pans, I mixed together one cup gound walnuts and 1 cup ground milk chocolate and spread it over the top of the batter and pressed it in.  It has given it a delicious crust.  Will make again.",

I made this twice and both times it stuck to the bottom of my loaf pans, and I greased the heck out of them to prevent sticking.  Don't know why it did that, but oh well.  The kids snitched slices all day long both times I made it and it was gone before I knew it. I added some chocolate chips to one batch and I think I like it best that way...chocoholic that I am.",

I substituted 1/2c. unsweetened applesauce and 1/2c. coconut oil for the vegetable oil. I also, cut the sugar to 1 cup. 1/2c. was granular sugar, the other half was brown rice sugar. The last alteration was to substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. The mini-muffins cooked 12 minutes @ 350 degrees and the regular size muffins baked about 15-16 minutes at the same temperature. It will be hard to keep these muffins around. They are so good!",

I doubled the recipe, and added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, it made 4 loaves... although I think next time I'll make muffins out of it because the loaves don't rise very much, so they look anemic. That said- whoever won't eat them for looks- GOOD! because that leaves more for me! ;) I used the Mazola Pure cooking spray to grease the pans and I had no problem with sticking. This is good stuff!

        "Review": "YUMMY.  I followed the recipe, except I ran out of sugar after 1 cup, so I substituted about half a cup of brown sugar for the rest. I baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes.  But next time I will reduce the time a little bit because I think I might have dried it out a little.  Maybe I should have taken it out of the oven at about 45 minutes when the toothpick inserted came out a little messy and let it finish off outside of the oven. It smelled great while baking and I could not wait to try it.  I love it.  I am eating it so fast, I am almost choking.  This is like a chocolate cake with zucchinis.  I grated the zucchinis by hand and did not wring out the moisture.  Next time I may add a cup of golden raisins because I think it would complement the taste.  And maybe reduce the amount of sugar to 1 cup.  Thanks for a great recipe.",

Granted, I did add chocolate chips (about 1 cup?), but still... :) As I usually do, I subbed applesauce in place of about half the oil.

Also, makes more than 10 servings, unless you eat really big servings!!  But I'm sure one loaf will freeze well. Thanks for a fun way to eat zucchini!",

It is moist and delicious. I added a 1/2 cup more zucchini and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips. I also made 1 loaf and 12 muffins, just because I only have 1 loaf pan.\r\nDefinitely a recipe that I will call upon to use up more zucchini!!!",

I replaced the oil with unsweetened applesauce, cut the sugar a little, replaced about 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour, and stirred in a package of mini semi sweet chocolate chips into a double batch. We got 2 large loaves, a pan of 8 mini loves, and one loaf in pan that is a little smaller than normal. My kids & husband love it. We warmed slices of it last night, topped with ice cream and dark chocolate syrup for a quick but awesome dessert!  UPDATE:  This bread kept very well in the refrigerator, and froze and thawed very well also.  We served the dessert I mentioned earlier to guests and they requested it again the last night they stayed with us!  I do tend to measure the zucchini a little on the heavy side, (heaped up a bit) if that helps anyone else's measurements.  Super recipe!",

So even though we finished off the first batch when it was fresh, we had enough left over which didn't last any longer than one week but a few days, still, I guess it does \"age\" pretty well and stays moist!  It's really yummy and although I almost thought there was just a bit too much bite from the cinnamon (I doubled the recipe), my 4 yr and 5 yr really liked it!  I have to admit I also even used wheat flour instead of all purpose white, but it still came out great!  I was quite tempted to try it with chocolate chips too but it was chocolaty enough without!",

I also used only 1/2 C of oil and 1/2 C. of cinnamon apple sauce, and I used 2 c white flour, 1/2 C wheat flour,trying to make it a bit healthier.  Not as sweet as my normal chocolate muffin, but still very good, especially with the chocolate chips.  It made 12 large muffins, 24 mini muffins.",

One reviewer mentioned her bread came out on the dry side so I didn't squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini, and still the bread was a bit drier than other zucchini breads I've made, but this is by no means a bad thing.  On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it an 11, it was that good.  Thanks for sharing!",

I made banana zucchini bread and this chocolate zucchini and everyone liked the other one better! this just didn't have much flavor though i used a good quality (ghiradelli) cocoa powder and wonderful fresh zucchini. it was fine, moist enough and the texture was good (i did 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil) but just too bland. it would be a lot better with some mini chocolate chips and maybe nuts in there.",

There is just enough chocolate to taste it, but it doesn't overpower the taste of the bread.  As some other reviewers did, I added a little more zucchini and used 1/2 c. oil and 8 oz. of unsweetened applesauce. The two loaves were finished up quickly as everyone in the family loved it.  I can see what it has so many great reviews.  This is a terrific recipe.",

I now make it with 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, half the sugar, 1 cup of nuts(whatever kind I have on hand), 2/3 cup of chocolate or white chips, and have even thrown in dried cranberries!

Makes great mini loafs as well. This will be one I make around the Holidays to share. Already shredding extra zucchini from the garden and freezing in zipper bags for holiday baking when my garden is no longer with us. Highly recommend this recipe.",

        "Review": "I've wanted to make this bread for awhile.  Not because it sounds great, because let's face it.  Chocolate and Zucchini.  No, just no.  But I love zucchini bread and I have been so curious!  I had to sub 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil because although we have avocado oil, olive oil, sesame oil...  too many oils to mention, I  ran out of  vegetable oil!  Avocado oil might have been okay but I didn't want to risk it.  Chocolate and avocado sounds worse than zucchini... anyhoo So after I dumped in the 1/2 cup of cocoa I made a sad face like this :( and tossed in an extra 2 tablespoons.  That cup of cocoa looked lonely.  Oh goodness the batter smelled delicious. Baked it for an hour, but I think that was just a smidge too long for me.  Next time I'll take it out a few min. earlier.  <br/><br/>This bread... makes an awesome peanut butter sandwich. haha!  My kids really liked it, even though my son claims he does not like chocolate.  I'm glad I tried it!",

        "Review": "I make a ton of quick breads, and this one was very good. I often have a surplus of zucchini in the summer and often forget I can use it for bread. Adding the cocoa transforms a so-so bread recipe into something special. Also, I had never before made a quick bread that didn't instruct you to mix dry ingredients in one bowl, wet ingredients in another. I used one big mixing bowl and everything worked out fine, saving me additional clean-up. I also forgot to peel the zucchini...no problem! Next time, I'll add a few walnuts.I also cut back a bit on the sugar, to 1 3/4 cups and it was just sweet enough.",

        "Review": "This is very good, it does taste like cake. I doubled the recipe, and I'm sure it's really good as-is, but I did do a few substitutions: I used 1 1/4 c. oil and 6 oz. nonfat vanilla yogurt. I cut the sugar a bit, using 2 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar. I used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour. In a doubled recipe, 1/2 tsp. baking powder didn't seem like enough to 2 tsp. baking soda, so I upped the baking powder to 1 scant tsp. (for the doubled recipe). I drained my zucchini (which I did not peel), but I think my substitutions of half whole wheat flour and nonfat yogurt made the bread need extra moisture, so I might not do that next time. I made 24 muffins and threw them in the freezer, so my husband can take them to work, and I also got 3 loaves, a little smaller than 8x4. Thanks for this great recipe.",

You can use part whole wheat flour, or ground flax seed, and swap out part of the oil for applesauce and the bread is still delicious.  I never take the time to peel the zucchini and most of the time shred that in the food processor.  First time I made muffins today and got 30 out of the batch, took 20 minutes at 350.  I also always reduce the cinnamon, and add about 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp white pepper.  Thank you for sharing \"itsjustme\", this is a family favorite that we make all summer and freeze for later on.",

        "Review": "I'm always disappointed to see peeled zucchini in zucchini bread.... It loses the point of having it there I think. I didn't peel the zucchini, used 1.5 cups of sugar rather than 2 and organic spelt flour. It turned out AMAZING! I've made it twice and it's like eating cake. My 3 year old son took it to his school for snack time and everyone raved. I think the base recipe is excellent but encourage people to get the full benefit out of using a veggie by not peeling it - it doesn't affect the texture but adds fiber and nutrients to a treat :) Thanks for the recipe!",

The texture was still excellent. <br/><br/>I made them into muffins, rather than bread.  I baked them for about 20 minutes. Then I wrapped them individually in Saran wrap and froze them.  I LOVE being able to pull out one chocolate zucchini muffin at a time and snack.",

        "Review": "We  loved it!  made muffins. Inspired by several reviews I made a few changes/ additions. I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, and did half cup oil and half a cup apple-butter since I didn't have applesauce. I had .5 cup dark chic chips, .5 cup semi sweet and .5 cup mini semi sweet.  Then sprinkled sugar in the raw on top, 2 packets total the ones at the coffee bar at your coffee shop. The kids and I  anxiously awaited and loved them! Made 23 cooked at 350 for 23 ish minutes rotating the pans between the shelfs half way through! Thank you!",

        "Review": "After much protesting, I finally got my family to try zucchini bread.  Ok, so I didn't tell them that it was zucchini bread until they ate it, but a girl has to do what a girl has to do.  So naturally the next step was to try chocolate zucchini bread.  They all liked it, but they original version went over much better.  However tomorrow I am going to run to the store and pick up some heavy cream and fresh strawberries.  I have a feeling that if I cut some thick slices and top it with berries and real whipped cream this will be the new winner.  Thanks for another delicious way to use up zucchini.",

        "Review": "When I tasted one pretty fresh from the oven, I admit I felt a little disappointed. I tried another the next morning, and it was a lot better. The flavors had mellowed and blended really nicely. I did make them with some modifications suggested by other reviewers, subbing 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil, reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (I used a mix of white and brown), and adding some chocolate chips. At first the applesauce was overpowering, but again, letting them cool overnight really did the trick. I'll make this recipe again. Oh, and I also chose to make them as muffins; baking for 20 minutes at 350 was perfect for my oven.",

I followed the directions almost to a T- the only thing I did different was use a bit more zucchini than it called for as I had several tiny ones I needed to use up. I poured the batter into two pans of the size called for, popped them in the oven, and after 45 minutes poked them with a toothpick, which came out clean. Unfortunately I think I should have poked them about ten minutes sooner because its not very moist like so many people are saying. You definitely need something to drink with it and not because its overly sweet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, with a properly adjusted cook time (I&#039;m thinking 30 to 35 minutes) I think this would turn out beautifully! The flavor is very good, and I hope it will be a hit at our party tonight!",

By reducing the amount of sugar, I think I sacrificed taste!.  I would make again using less oil and sugar, as the texture of the bread seemed to be the same.  However, I think I&#039;ll add 1 teaspoon of instant coffee, which I find enhances the chocolate flavor and either chopped walnuts or chocolate chips.  As written, it&#039;s a very delicious recipe!

I also added 1/4 tsp. espresso powder. The loaves came out beautifully!",

I don&#039;t know if this is anywhere in the comments but I did not drain the zucchini (i.e. press the liquid out).  I think this would be really good with some raisins in it as well.",

We are trying to reduce sugar and carbs where ever we can so we cut the amount of sugar in half and used 1 cup instead of the  2 cups speceified in the recipe. It was moist and still sweet enough for us and completely satisfied our chocolate craving. I also used while wheat flour and coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. Will definitely make again.",

        "Review": "WOW! This. Tastes. Amazing! I didn't have two loaf pans, so I baked this as a sheet cake (for 39 minutes) after adding an extra 2/3 cup or so of shredded zucchini. The cake had the perfect consistency throughout and was unbelievably moist and delicious. I don't typically like cinnamon with chocolate, but in this case it actually gave cake a deeper flavor profile with a very subtle spice undertone. Then I frosted the cake with regular creamy peanut butter and the taste went from amazing to EPIC! This recipe's definitely a keeper!",

        "Review": "OMG!!!!! I've had regular zucchini bread, but never chocolate zucchini bread. And, I've never made either. I could hurt someone over this stuff! Yes, it's THAT good!!! OK, for the most part I followed the recipe exactly. However, I did use a couple of suggestions that were made here. I did add mini chocolate chips and sprinkled raw sugar on the top. OH, and I added carrots with the zucchini. Now, I used my mandolin slicer to &quot;shred&quot; the zucchini and carrots and it came out more like a pulp. So, I drained that off as much as possible. In all, to make 2 cups, I used 3 zucchinis and 2 carrots. I only have 1 loaf pan, so I decided to make mini muffins first, then I poured the rest of the batter into my loaf dish. On 350 with convection, the muffins took 20 minutes. The loaf, however ended up taking 1 hour and 20 minutes. Maybe there was a little too much batter in the loaf pan because it took forever for me to get a clean toothpick in the middle. But, when all said and done......... THESE WERE AMAZING!!!!",

        "Review": "This recipe was DELICIOUS! The only reason it got 4 stars not 5 is there are a few changes that made it better. 1) chocolate chips are a must, it took it to another level and may have been a bit bland without. 2) I had 2 medium/large zucchinis but that only yielded 1.5 cups shredded, fortunately I had a ripe banana on hand to make up the difference but I would say that should be adjusted in the ingredients. 3) Despite greasing the pans, they did stick to the bottom (the banana bread I made last weekend in this same pan did not) so would line the bottoms with parchment next time. That being said, so moist, so delicious, relatively easy and the cinnamon adds a nice depth to the flavour, I would definitely make this again.",

I used a cup of oats grinded in my blender to make them into flour, added regular unbleached flour to make the 2 1/2 cups. I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup EVOO and 1/2 cup of applesauce, and about 11 oz of zucchini pulsed in my food processor until pretty mushy. And I added 3/4 cups of chocolate chips. I make cups cakes baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Perfection! These came out great and he kids loved them! Great recipe! Thank you!",

There is way too much chocolate in them; when cooled they hardly stay together. I wasnt very thrilled about the meringue on top either. Im sorry... these just werent what Id thought they would be.  I will try again with changes in the future.",

I did have to cook it about 35-40 minutes before it came to a boil, but that could have been due to my stove's \"low\" setting being lower than most. Also, this seemed to make a lot of dry mix, so I 1/4 the dry ingredients because I didn't want to make that much. I really liked the fact that you can make up a batch of the dry ingredients ahead of time to make when needed. Thank you for this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper.",

I also skipped the whipped cream garnish in a new years attempt at cutting back on the extras. Truthfully, even without the Kahlua and whipped cream this is still a rich creamy cup of goodness. I made a single cup and used fat free creamer for the half and half. The chocolate shines and the coffee gives an outstanding performance in a supporting role and that are an ideal team.

One thing to remember is to generously coat the dough ball in powdered sugar.  Cover it well enough that you can't see any dough through it.  Pack it on.  Then when you put in on the sheet, flatten slightly with the palm of your hand.  This makes for prettier cookies.  I've never greased the sheets, since they are so covered in powdered sugar.  My preference is a soft cookie, so bake 8-10 minutes only.",

I have to say, this is like a brownie in cookie form and it is so good with a small scoop of ice cream on top of it! I had one by itself and it was so fudgy and delicious! I melted the chocolate on defrost mode in the microwave (keep an eye on it!) and whisked it smooth and immediately started to make the recipe. I stuck the batter in the freezer for about an hour and made them into small balls. I did not flatten them, they flattened out themselves while baking forming these beautiful crackles all over the cookie from the powdered sugar. They smelt so good when they came out the oven and tasted even better! Thank for posting.",

Soft, chocolaty and just sweet enough.They came out perfect. Didn't have unsweetened so I subtituted bittersweet, with sm. amount of cocoa powder and oil, and a tad less sugar.

The taste is great! Just wish they didn't spread so much....I used 2 different pans (teflon &amp; baking stone) to see if that would help, but to no avail. I also read the reviews and made sure that the cookies were covered in icing sugar &amp; the dough was kept in the fridge overnight for about 22 hours. I think I did everything right! Guess they are iceburg cookies this year! :)",

My only problem (and it's probably my technique as I'm new to this) was that it wasn't firm enough to hold it's shape when cut.  I'm thinking maybe I didn't cook it long enough but will be making this again and I'm sure perfection will come with practice.  That said the flavor of the rich chocolate can't be beat.  Thanks Carole for a wonderful recipe.",

But my husband preferred his grandmother's version (understandable), and she only uses a 1/3 cup of flour and does not bring it to a boil, just to the point of thickening. She also said that she forgot all about adding any salt. Hers tastes great, but it did not cut into actual slices.",

A couple notes: I made it the night before and left it in the fridge overnight. I used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 in the filling and 1% milk. The finished pie had a little bit of syrupy liquid in it. Apparently this is from the meringue and is completely normal, it did not change the taste of the pie at all. I also used a store bought graham cracker pie crust which worked just fine. It set almost immediately and cut into real slices. Great recipe.",

I made sure to stir continuously using a wooden spoon in a non-stick pan on medium heat and I couldn't even let it come to a boil as it was thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan.  So I went ahead and put half into a bowl with the egg yolks stirred well return egg mixture to pan, still stirring continuously it was starting to smooth out but then before it could reach boiling point, it started thickening up so much it was pulling away from the pan again and cramping my hand.  Please give me suggestions as to what may have caused this or how to prevent that from happening should I try and make it again in the future.  Thanks, Regina",

Had no trouble getting it to set up. Very easy to make if you&#039;re handy with a whisk. I was careful to add the mixture to my yolks very gradually. And keeping my whites refrigerated seemed to help the meringue set up better. I&#039;ve made it with and without crust and love it both ways.",

Perhaps because of this, I found one large onion to be sufficient.  The onion/flour mixture seemed to soak up the 1 oz of butter, so I ended up adding another 5 Tbls...perhaps I added too much since I wasn't sure it was really 'paste'.  I'll try adding less next time. Instead of stock from the chicken, I used four cups of bullion.  Also, I added some broccoli with the chicken.\nThe end result is very nice over some brown rice. =)",

I used all whole-wheat pastry flour, 1/4 cup canola oil, 3 tsp baking soda, milk, 1 cup chopped fresh cherries, 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup pecans and a little shy of 1/2 cup sugar.  I wanted to use some of the other  options- like cornmeal or oatmeal or use something else for the milk, but their cupbords are pretty bare compared to mine so I'll have to wait til I get home!!  Rest assured I will be coming back to this recipe again.  The muffins rose beautifully and taste great- just moist enough.  Thank you for this amazingly versatile muffin recipe!",

        "Review": "Delicious! I used several of the suggestions - used soy flour and water instead of egg and used 50% WW flour instead of all white. Additions were 3/4 cup grated carrots, 3/4 cup banana, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Also, used 1 TB baking powder instead of 2 tsp (as suggested). I used 3 TB ground flaxseed and only 1 TB canola oil. Oh and no sugar, just 1.5 tsp sweet n low. And used NF dry milk and water instead of regular milk - probably about 1.5 cups - one cup just wasn't nearly enough. The muffins are great - rose very nicely. I make muffins pretty often - nice when bread is running low and to use up fruit (like bananas) that are starting to go. Great recipe, very easy to adapt. \r\n\r\nNot sure what is up with 3 hours preparation . . . twenty minutes, maybe",

We used a tin of pears (drained) pureed and \"hid\" a tsp in the middle of each muffin to which I had added some vanilla and cinnamon. The next batch used the rest of the pear puree in lieu of the fat and some sour cherries that I wanted to use up. They are fantastic! This is the only recipe I'll use for muffins now! They're rapidly going to turn into \"kitchen sink\" muffins!!! Thanks Carole!",

I simply incorporated them while I was adding the sugar.  It seemed to work just fine.  I played with my red and green food colouring.  Instead of adding them and mixing well, I only swirled them in.  This gave it the look of peppermints.  The cooking time was right on for me.  It worked out to 4 small cookie sheets of \"kisses\" for me.  I think it would probably be about 24-30 kisses.  It was hard to count as they were being snatched up before I could even get the rest out of the oven.  This is a keeper.  I think next time I might add a little peppermint extract to give it a hint of mint.  Great recipe.",

I tried a different meringue recipe earlier today and they did not hold their shape as well as these did.

I tried to keep this lower fat to stay close to my diet, so I used fat-free mayo, fat-free cream cheese, and fat-free cheddar in this, and it still tasted fantastic! I did go ahead and mix all the cheese into the dip before heating since fat-free cheese doesn't like to melt on top but will when it is stirred into a dish. It warmed up very nicely and was great on crackers! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I had to use 2 cans of drained crab meat (4.25oz each), which made the texture a bit weird, but the flavor was divine. I look forward to someday making this with fresh crabmeat. The combo with the broccoli flavor was a good one, but I might try celery next time to get more of the solo dip flavor.",

        "Review": "This was a pretty good dip, but I find that it is lacking something and I just don't know what. The tangy/sour flavor from the cream cheese,sour cream and lemon juice was certainly overpowering the whole dip. It needed something with a spicy taste, I think, to balance the flavor. Also, The cheese I had melted on top(cheddar) had a layer of oil from cooking.After it had cooled a little the whole top layer of cheese came off in one piece. Maybe next time (if I remake it)I will mix all the cheese in to the main mix. Other than those small flaws it was edible and the flavor of the crab meat really came through.",

Needless to say it went fast. I doubled the ingredients to make twice as much and all the measurements worked fine. I did add a little more cheddar cheese to the dip...just about 2 more TBSP because I love cheese and apparently so does everyone else. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks!",

        "Review": "I tripled this recipe. I used the imitation crab meat as it was $18.00 a pound for crabmeat and you can only buy it by the pound I did not want to spend $36.00 on one ingredient. My daughter tasted it the morning I took it out of the oven and told me, \"Mom, they are going to LOVE this.\"  Sure enough they did. I took it to monthly birthday celbration at 8:00 AM by 8:55 AM it was GONE! People were eating it like it was a cassarole. I didn't even get to taste it! It was fantastic, evidently!!!I a ton of emails asking for the recipe. I followed the recipe to a tee except that I put probably twice as much cheese as the recipe called for.",

I followed the directions exactly except I used 2 cans of lump crab meat and didn't have any dry or even dejon mustard, so I subbed a squirt of yellow mustard.  I probably used quarter cup of cheese in the dip and another 1/2 cup on top.  I took a bag of pita chips to dip and kept going back for more!  I am going to make this again for my new years eve party!  Thanks for great recipe!",

I used about 3/4 lb. of fresh backfin crabmeat.\n\nI didn't like it hot!  Right out of the oven, it seemed bland.  HOWEVER, after sitting in the refrigerator overnight, I decided to spread it on club crackers just because I didn't want to waste it.  Oh how wonderful it is as a cold spread!!!   I ate the whole thing in two days time!!  Who knows, maybe slightly heating it at this point, with the flavors all mingled, it might be good hot.  I will remember this as a wonderful cold spread!",

Anyway, I used backfin crab and it seemed a little fishy, so next time I'll go for higher quality. I used a pre-shredded cheddar and for the milk, used 1/2 and 1/2. Everything else I did as indicated. The combination of ingredients was just wonderful and I can't wait to make this again.  Thank you to Lee and crabplace.com!",

        "Review": "With all these great reviews I hate to be the one who has something negative to say, but my family and I didn't really care for this recipe as written.  I doubled the recipe, and didn't use the cheddar cheese, that was the only change I made, and we all thought it was very bland.  Before baking, I added a lot of old bay (maybe a ts or 2) and hot sauce (maybe 3 or 4 Tb) and we finially liked it.  I mixed it up the day before, and baked it covered for an hour, then uncovered for 20 minutes, with a little old bay sprinkled on top.  After those changes it was fantastic.  Thanks for posting anyway, I doubt I'll ever make crab dip any other way.",

        "Review": "This has been my go-to recipe for the past 6+ years! It's the perfect accompaniment to crab...not too overpowering. Good bread is necessary! The only two additions I make are 2 tbsp grated onion mixed in with everything else and a sprinkling of Old Bay (or J.O.'s) on the top before baking. NOTE: If you pick the crabs yourself and they have been steamed in Old Bay, DO NOT add the old bay or garlic salt or it gets WAY TOO SALTY!) If you want to freeze to save for another night, be sure to bake it but not for the whole time—closer to 20/25 mins—then you can reheat in the microwave or toaster. If you don't cook it it ends up separating. I usually split the recipe and have half that night and half the next weekend. Enjoy!",

It took a bit longer than the last 8 minutes for the potatoes to cook, so I just covered, lowered the heat, and simmered for another 10.  It lacked something when finished cooking, so we added about 1 tsp of chicken soup base and a bit of water.  Very tasty all in all, served over rice.",

        "Review": "I served this as part of a Thai dinner for friends.  We all agreed that it left a bit to be desired.  It wasn't bad, not at all.  It just didn't \"WOW!\" any of us.  Being unfamiliar with Thai cooking, part of the problem may lie with me.  I did not know for how long to soak my mushrooms, so they may not have soaked long enough before I had to add them to the dish.  At this time, the recipe does not indicate how much or what type of oil to use for cooking the shallots and garlic.  I started with sesame oil and then re-cooked shallots in vegetable oil and combined the two oils when I tossed and coated the noodles.  I still don't think I had enough oil to properly coat the noodles, and by this time it was too late to try and flavor my third round of oil, as my meat was all cooked and waiting for my noodles to be added.  I might try this again and see if I can make any improvement on my technique.",

I used a bit more chili than called for, and dried \"pork floss\" rather than dried shrimp, since I had that on hand.  There was a bit too much liquid though, so next time I'd use half the fish sauce and half the lime.  If you haven't used the fish sauce before, don't worry--it isn't fishy.  It gives more of a salty flavor.",

        "Review": "Okay.  These bars were delicious, but I did have a few issues.  1) I had a hard time getting the amount of dough to stretch through the pan. It worked, but I think maybe a bit more dough would have been helpful.  2) there definitely was not enough preserves (at least not in my opinion).  I used about 4 more ounces of preserves in order to get a nice layer over the bars.  I did feel as though there was a bit too much meringue, so I left off just a tad bit of it.  Overall, this recipe is fantastic, and they make for fabulous crowd pleasers.  I finished these minutes before my guests arrived, and they were gone before I knew it... They didnt even give me a chance to photograph these lovely little finger-food delights...  Next time! Because there WILL be a next time.  These were thoroughly enjoyed.  (But next time I may leave the nuts off! :) )",

I used fat free, evaporated milk, instead of whipping cream (as another reviewer suggested), as the soup was still creamy, hearty and delicious.  I had no parsley, so I omitted it.  I used Old Bay seasoning, lemon pepper, and salt to season, but felt something was missing so I added a good tablespoon or two, of Emerils original seasoning.  That did the trick.  If you don't have Emeril's, I think a good spice mix of garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, paprika and extra salt will give it an extra kick that puts it over the top.  I served it hot with some extra shredded cheddar over the top.  I will definitely be making this to impress at my next dinner party!",

Indeed, the end result did not quite taste like the crab bisque I usually have in restaurants.  The only thing that made it taste like crab bisque was the sherry. I feel that it lacks something but still have not quite found out what it is lacking.  I won't be trying this again.",

        "Review": "I would just like to remind those believing this to be vegan, that it is infact not. Well, everything on the recipe IS vegan, aside for the granulated sugar. \r\n\r\nAny sugar that isn't directly from the Sugar Cane itself and untreated (such as Succanat, or other natural sugars such as Agave Necter) are 100% NON-VEGAN. \r\n\r\nGranulated sugar is made with ground animal bones. The animal bones are almost completely incinerated to leave active carbon, which is used to remove colour from the raw cane sugar; thus making it WHITE. Giving it the \"bleached\" look.\r\n\r\nSuprisingly enough, not many people know this.. infact, the majority of VEGANS I meet know nothing of this. But I hope it helps! \r\n\r\nI would suggest substituting the granulated sugar for things like natural honey, agave necter or succanat. These are all extremely healthy substitues that still taste great. \r\n\r\nInfact, out of all the alternatives I listed, 100% natural/organic and unprocessed Honey is incredibly healhty for you, it has countless health benefits, so much that I doubt it would fit here! lol!\r\n\r\nDo yourselves a favor and do a little research, find out which form of sweetening is best for you!\r\n\r\nTo all vegans reading this - Enjoy your long and healthy lives!",

I think i may have to add bacon bits to mine just to load them up next time.

I topped the potatoes with bacon and cheddar and it still wasn't enough to redeem them.  Next time I will add a strong cheddar to the potatoe mash and hope for better results.  A good base recipe.",

The second batch, I left 1/3 of the pears chopped and pureed the rest.  I combined them just  before canning them.  That way the butter had fruit chunks in it.  It was great both ways.  This is definately my favorite canning recipe.  I couldn\\'t believe how wonderful my kitchen smelled with the fresh herbs simmering away.  I even saved the juice stock, strained it, and added a little sugar.  Made a wonderful spiced pear drink.  ",

It will make good gifts.  I got a bit over 9 half-pints.  I didn't peel and core my pears, I just removed the stem and blossom end, cooked, and put through a sieve.  I think this gave me more pulp than if you peel and core them.  I also used apple cider instead of the apple juice.  My end product is a medium brown color.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I am lucky to have a neighbor a house away with a huge, productive pear tree ... and she cannot begin to use them all! ",

I used the chinois sieve and also made drinks from the extra liquid I drained off. I used 6 cinn. stix, 4 1/2 cu. apple juice, 6 minced slices of gingerroot, 12 whole cloves and 5 1/2 cu. sugar. I put pulp thru a wire strainer also. No gritty things ! It took 35 minutes longer for each step. An hour to thicken and it is heavenly in 7 pints. Use wide mouth so you can get every last bit.

A bit heavy on the sweet so next time I will use maybe 1/2 the sugar or no sugar, as I tend to use over-ripe fruit just for the natural sweet!

        "Review": "Excellent recipe - very easy to prepare as well.  Instead of pan frying after marinading I made a foil tent for the lamb and poured the marinade over the lamb then baked in a 350 oven for about 1 1/2 hours - excellent flavor.  Poured the sauce over the lamb and the lemon rice side I prepared.  Will be using this recipe as a regular for our lamb chops.  Thanks for posting.",

        "Review": "Excellent recipe. It is very easy.  I used less salt without any negative affect and instead of using butter and sauteing the lamb we used butter spray and used our stovetop grill pan.  My brilliant husband (he wanted me to make sure and put that part) put pieces of pineapple on the grill as well and it took up some of the flavors of the meat.  All were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe! We'll use it again - for company!",

        "Review": "I hate when people start with &quot;I used this instead of...&quot; But I didn't have enough lemon juice. The lamb chops were small, and I had about 2/3 the amount of lemon required. I just used 2/3 the other ingredients too. I also had some preserved lemons. I took 1/4 of a preserved lemon and squeezed it into the marinade. I also added about 2T of nice olive oil and marinated all day. (I used Madras Curry powder) I also seasoned with black pepper before frying I used olive oil and butter to fry the chops. I served with lemon rice and asparagus with lemon zest, oil oil, garlic, and kosher salt roasted in the oven at 400 degrees about 7 minutes. Amazing flavor! Thank you!",

For Easter dinner 2010, I had gorgeous lamb chops that I wanted as the stars of dinner, with just a hint of sauce so they weren't over-whelmed by flavour. This sauce fit the bill perfectly! The lemon is a nice addition to the usual mint sauce that is dumped onto lamb; this was light, flavourful and had a nice combo of sweet & savory. Every one of our guests at Easter raved about this sauce!",

        "Review": "We've made quite a lot of changes to the recipe, so I'm not rating it, but we 've been very pleased by the result, so I wanted to share!  We started with fresh spinach, so we added them to the onion together with the garlic and cooked them for a few minutes, until done. Then we let the mixture cool, salted it a little bit, but not too much since we  used 2/3 cup goat milk feta and added about 3 tbsp grated pecorino romano in step 2. We also used more  garlic (6 cloves, finely chopped)and shrimps (9 ounces frozen, then thawed a steamed and cut them into 1/2\" pieces) and added a lightly beaten egg to the filling (even though I'm not sure it's essential ; I just did it because I usually do when I make spanakopita). And we made this into a pie ( in a 9\" pie dish), using 4 lightly buttered phyllo sheets for the bottom a 3 sheets for the top. Only 2 tbsp butter were needed for brushing the dough sheets. We cooked it for 30 minutes at 350 F. Thank you for posting, Dragon Mom!",

        "Review": "Very yummy.  I added parsley, dill, and parmesan to the mix.  I also cooked fresh spinach (it took a 40 oz bag!).  These are greasy and even started a fire in my oven!  After the first batch I used a jelly-roll pan so the butter couldn't drip off.  There's no need to re-butter the pan after the first batch.  My hubby accidentally bought fat free cream cheese, which I thought would ruin them, but they turned out fine.  I found the phyllo dough web site to be of great help  www.athens.com  with folding the triangles.  Recipezaar had the better idea of cutting the 2\" strips before unrolling, though.  Make sure you keep any dough you're not immediately working with under a damp towel.  It will be ruined if you don't. ",

I figured at least a 1/2 hour, if not more time.  The recipe is very authentic though, and I usually make it with one less potato. The suggestion to have some oil in the pan before you pour the eggs is VERY important.  Thanks for the recipe!",

It's tasteless without a lot of salt.  My DH thought it was okay.  I did change the recipe a little, though, to make it a bit easier. 1) To shorten the amount of cooking time, I pricked each potato a few times with a fork, and then microwaved them between two moist paper towels for about 6-8 minutes, or until starting to get soft.  I cut them into chunks (using a pot holder, of course).  I always leave the skin on as it doesn't take away from the taste and does add a little nutrition.  2) I didn't clean the pan between cooking the potatoes and onions and cooking it with the eggs and I had no problem.  I did add about 2 Tbsp. of oil first, though.  3) I added about 1 1/2 - 2 tsp. of salt.  4) I added some sliced scallions/green onions for color.  5) I cooked the omelet on high and waited a few minutes so that I only had to cook each side once.

Just drop the potato slices into the skillet and stir often to prevent burning and sticking.

        "Review": "I've made a very similar recipe from an authentic source in the high school Spanish classes that I teach.  Tips:  First, just use ordinary olive oil, not an extra virgin, as if won't be able to take the heat.  To avoid crispy potatoes, be sure the oil is at the right temperature (potatoes should cook slowly when dropped in, and shouldn't sound like french fries in a deep frier) and that potatoes are sliced equally thin (my students do this with a mandoline).  My recipe also includes some garlic, which we crush and sautee with the onions in a separate pan just to make things easier (and to give another student a job to do).  The potatoes should NOT be stireed, as they tend to break up and release more starch this way.  One at a time (employ the assistance of another pair of hands to speed this up if you're not cooking alone) is the best way to go.  Keep in mind, you want evenly tender, cooked potatoes.  No browning.  These aren't french fries!  I'm not sure 1 cup of oil is enough.  We don't usually measure, just fill a skillet almost 1/2 full with olive oil, heat, and then put in potatoes as long as they are all covered , so you don't have to stir.  One reviewer mentioned needing a lot of salt.  I had this problem the first time I made it in class as well.  I had skipped a step in my recipe, which recommends salting the potatoes before cooking, along with seasoning the egg with a little salt and pepper.  This really helps a lot, as salting afterwards just doesn't seem to do it.  The salt doesn't penetrate, and you end up with a really salty outside & lack of flavor inside.  If done correctly, the tortilla should only be flipped once.  High heat when you first drop the egg mixture into the pan is important, as in the original recipe.  This helps to avoid sticking.  However, I don't know that I'd go all the way to the smoking point.  Do reduce the heat and allow to cook slowly right after putting the eggs and potatoes into the pan.  Frequent shaking really isn't necessary.  Just run a rubber scraper around the edge and give it a good shake to loosen before you do the famous \"flip.\"  When the outside edges start to look dry and only the middle looks slightly runny, it's about time to flip.  I'm generally not a big fan of browned eggs, but in this dish, it's necessary and normal for the outside to brown, and no, it doesn't taste like an overcooked dry omlette.  This is totally different!  Yes, you can do the flip!  The first time I did it was in front of 20 teenagers, and I managed it!  The method in the recipe works well, but as you slide back into the pan, have a rubber scraper ready to tuck any potatoes that try to escape back into the eggs.  In Spain, this is served cut into wedges, either hot or cold, and yes, often in sandwiches.  I had never had leftovers to sample cold until this past semester, and WOW, is that good!  The most amazing part of this dish is that I always have students who don't like one or more of the ingredients, but somehow, the combination of all of them ends up creating something that appeals to nearly everyone.  I've only come across one high school student who did not like the dish, and everyone at least tries it.  (They're teenagers, they can't NOT try it!)  We didn't do anything other than pour excess oil out of the pan in between steps, there was no need to clean the pan.  The oil from frying the potatoes can be poured back into the bottle when cooled and stored in the refrigerator for future frying uses.  It will solidify in the refrigerator, but don't be alarmed.  It's still useable and will return to liquid form at room temperature.  Enjoy your tortilla espanola!  It IS a lot of work, but the flavor is worth the effort!  This is the minimalist, traditional recipe.  Once you master it, have fun with it and add whatever you want.  I won't tell the Spaniards you aren't making it the 'traditional' and 'authentic' way!  :)",

I also used a 10 inch pan with vertical walls so it could have better volume and shape. Therefore, I used 6 jumbo eggs instead of 4. I spent one semester in spain and this definitely is the real thing or really close to it. But as always every taste is different and you are allowed to change ingredients, times and utensils to be as creative as you can become. Thanks a lot kenk!",

        "Review": "This is one of my favorite foods.  Kenk's is a very traditional recipe and not unlike mine.  However, I do a few things differently.  I have found that coarsely grating my potatoes helps make the tortillas more stable during and after cooking.  I start my onions cooking while I'm grating the potatoes and I cook them in about 3T of olive oil.  I use almost as much onion as potato but I don't add garlic because it damages the delicate flavor of the tortilla and isn't as good cold.  The egg to potato ratio is very important.  Basically the egg mixture should easily cover the potatoes when you mix them together.  After you stir the potatoes into the eggs be sure to let them sit for 5 minutes before you pour them into the hot pan to form tortillas.  I use an 8\" omlet pan and usually cook two tortillas.  This pan makes the sliding / flipping process much easier and lets you peek under the edge for doneness.  I actually don't flip my tortillas.  I kept trying but had some incredibly horrible failures.  My method is to slide the tortilla onto a large plate and then invert the pan over it and flip the plate and pan quickly.  During the cooking process (before the slide) I take the pan off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes several time.  This helps the runny center set up.  Just be sure that it is hot and sliding around in the pan before you attempt the slide or flip.  You also want to be careful not to overcook because the finished tortilla is best with a creamy texture.  I frequently stray from the traditional by adding a small amount of grated cheddar to the mix (gives a beautiful golden quality to the crust) and sprinkling some on the finished tortilla.  I used to add red and yellow peppers but it too can overpower the simple but delicious flavor of the tortilla.  My husband cares less about tradition and likes crumbled bacon added to the mix.  I usually give in.  Last thing...practice makes perfect when it comes to tortillas so if your first few tries are less than stellar, don't give up!",

        "Review": "Delicious for DH, DD (toddler) & I as per my slight modifications. I used two medium small potatoes and 6 eggs but next time would use only 5. I cooked the potatoes in 1/2 inch of extra virgin olive oil (I do suggest regular olive oil like another reviewer because mine smoked too much). I did not let the potatoes brown much at all. I then added the onion in a lesser amount. I covered the pan to slightly steam the potatoes and onions in order not to brown them and to cook them faster. When they were just about cooked I added sea salt (which was not coarse) to them which I think is very important or the dish will come out to bland. I kept these for a few hours in the refridgerator until morning (suhoor) so it would be much faster to finish. This worked well. I finished the recipe as per instructions also giving a little bit of salt to the eggs. I will definitely make this again.",

The color and taste of these veggies is worth it.  I also added just under 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint.  I used only one tomato.  I  was remembering another recipe I used to have for this dish, which had the above items.  I always loved it, but my husband did not.  After making this version with the changes above, we found one that we both like.  Thanks for sharing; it's a keeper!",

A Feijoada is made from salted pork cuts (feet, tail, ears, ribs, etc) jerked beef and at least 2 kinds of sausage cooked on black beans and served aside with white rice, stewed kale, orange, fried pork lard and other which may be different on other regions.

Don't you know what you are doing? you are taking a traditional, delicious, food that you share with friends and family and you are putting TURKEY?!?!\nTry going to your local meat market (and i don't mean a bar) and get all the pork parts you can find and slow cook it for a few hours with traditional Brasilian spices... mean while drink some caipirinhas. Not too many otherwise you'll walk in zig-zag.  try that instead!",

        "Review": "Corrections: Wanderley is confusing the name of the fruit, which is very common among us Brazilians.  He means Lime, not lemon for the \"Caipirinha.\"  \r\nThis dish was actually created by Brazilian slaves, who didn't have much of a choice on the pork's parts they got.  Obviously, it has improved enormously since Colonial tims.  We use smoked meats, which gives it a delicious taste.  It's eaten with thinly sliced kale (\"Couve\") and peeled and sliced sweet oranges.  (I lived in Bahia, the State where this dish originated.)",

        "Review": "This is really almost excactly like the recipe I use for it and it is one of my all time favorite desserts.I use any combination of fresh or frozen berries morels or cherries that are available. I think the trick is to use fruit juice and red wine for the liquid instead of water as some other recipes do.It makes for a more intensive flavor.\r\nBTW, you could give it an additional english title such as red fruit pudding so that it is more easily found with the search engine(just a suggestion). Thanks for posting.",

I didn't have regular sour cream, so I used french onion flavoured sour cream, which added a great taste to it.  I also reserved some of the cheese to melt on top.  I will definitely make these again though!",

The next batch I made I used flat, greased pans. Then as it cooled, I poured it onto wax paper. They didn't make long chunks of candy but individual crystals. That was fine with me because I was looking for a space rock kind of looking candy and that's what I got. I also colored the candy with food coloring for a cool effect. Neato!",

        "Review": "Not sure why the person below only gave you 2 stars but this deserves 10 stars. Its simple easy and tastes great. We did use our KitchenAid stand mixer instead of the food processor....We did chilled the bowl and whisk. Since the recipe basically consists of one ingredient(can add salt if desired, which we did do) we just poured the whole 1 quart contianer of (ultra pasteurized(sp?)) heavy whipping cream into the bowl and let the KtichenAid whisk away. We had butter in about 8-9 minutes and it tastes wonderful!",

        "Review": "Yay!  I am so exicited I finally got this to work!  I have made butter before by skimming my own cream off of milk, but have never been able to get this to work. So, when I saw this recipe on this site, I thought I'd give it another shot.  I too used my kitchen aid mixer, which if you have one, I would reccommend. Simply because when it turn into butter, it all collects into the wisk an you can lift the top up and let it drip dry for a couple minutes!  The only thing I wasn't sure of was speed. What I learned was to use hi speed, but back it down a gear if it's splashing. When you start out it's a liquid. Start on speed 8 or it will spash. Once it takes on the whipping cream form, turn it on max. But stand by, because if your not there when the butter seperates from the liquid, it will go everywhere! So I slowly started backing it down!  After I put it in the bowl, I use the back of a spoon and squeeze out any excess milk I can and then I quicKly run cold water over it to wash it clean. just some tips I picked up from a butter making sight!  It's perfect and I am so happy to finally have this!! Thank You! 8-)",

        "Review": "5 Stars is a must!!! I make my butter the same way, but I do \"wash\" and \"work\" the butter after the separating process.  I add salt during the working process. I do a quart of cream at a time and it yields about 50/50 ratio of butter and buttermilk.  I let the buttermilk stand at room temperature for about 12 hours then refrigerate. Then the next morning make me some buttermilk biscuits and slather em up with some of that good ol butter.  P.S. Save a little buttermilk and add it to the cream the next time and let it sit out for a few hours at room temp to add a little extra flavor to the butter taste much deeper and complex.  Then start the process again.",

        "Review": "Super yummy! Although the dressing never thickened up & it was pretty runny. The chicken I used soaked up most of it, but if chicken wasn't used, the salad would have been a bit wet. the flavors were great. Will make again!",

        "Review": "I used the juice of just 1 orange in part because I only had balsamic vinegar and I thought the sweetness would be enough. I decided to wilt my bok choy a bit in the same pan I did the chicken in, and tossed it with the dressing in that pan. I also used bamboo shoots and some baby corn. I topped the salad with some toasted almonds for a tasty garnish. I made the dressing a day ahead and it really improved over the 24 hours.",

        "Review": "This is in fact not a Greek dish, but Turkish.  \"Dolma\" means \"Stuffing, Stuffed\" in Turkish and the origins of this dish go back to authentic Ottoman Imperial Cuisine. In fact there are very many other stuffed vegetable dishes in the Turkish Cuisine, such as eggplants, arthichokes, marrow(zuccihini) and its blossoms, potatoes etc.  This term, stuffed, is also used for dishes where chicken, turkey and the like are stuffed with various ingredients, mainly rice, before cooking usually in the oven.",

        "Review": "I followed this recipe exactly as written with the exception that I doubled it and I made a mixture of cornstarch and mil in hopes of thickening it somewhat as the broth was thin and needed more body. It is quite bland tasting but could be spiced up easily which I will do the next time around, and there will be a next time.  This is a very healthy chowder and with a few tweeks from the spice rack could be out of this world. If the intent of the originator of this chowder was to keep it healthy, I would not substitute half and half for milk.  I think it can be thickened nicely with a cornstarch or flour mixture; maybe even a roux. Thanks you Dreamgoddess for sharing your adopted recipe, it was definately worth saving.",

I also didn't add any liquids until after the fish cooked (this was by accident from not carefully reading the instructions!), and this allowed the fish and veggies to really absorb the seasonings. It was a mistake, but one I will repeat. This was a nice change from how I usually cook fish (sauteeing) and I will be making it throughout the cold months. Thanks!",

So, fish thawing, but I decided it was a night for comfort food, something warm and tasty - so I turned to RecipeZaar as always, and as always, I found the perfect recipe.\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows me, knows that I feel a recipe is just a guide - and this was the perfect 'guide' to start with.  The only changes I made were:\r\n\r\n - I used butter, \"rock fish\";whatever that is :), garlic (because one can't have too much garlic).  \r\n- As usual, I didn't measure the ingredients - just eyeballed it.\r\n- Once the potatoes were cooked, I smushed some of them, and then added the fish and some dried parsley.\r\n- Just before servicing, as a last minute thought, I sprinkled in some dried dill.\r\n\r\nYUM ....... very good - and my picky \"meat & potatoes Husband\" really liked it.  Perfect comfort food (and healthy)  Had just enough to reheat for my lunch today.  Will be making this again.  THANK YOU for the great guide :)",

        "Review": "I made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it!  I took half of an acorn squash, cubed it and added it to the choweder, along with the potatoes and other ingredients.  I boiled the other half, pureed it with 1/4 a cup of heavy cream and then added this to chowder.  This thickened up the base and of course, it adds a background flavor that won't overpower.  We will keep this in the rotation of \"cold night\" soups.",

        "Review": "This is a great recipe! It appears to be very simple and boring, but it's very delicious. I used a combination of whiting and fresh tuna instead of cod, but I suppose about any fish would be good. Very nice and easy! UPDATE: 5/10/16 I use Grouper cheeks in this and they hold together nicely. Also, having a son with a milk allergy I substitute Earth Balance original spread (butter substitute) and Silk Almond Milk. Instead of just water, I also add about 2 tsp of Better than Boullion Chicken Base DEE-LISH!",

Before adding the fish I used a handblender right in the pot and blended the soup to thicken it but leaving enough vegetables whole to have some texture. I will be making this recipe again.

        "Review": "We recently tried this recipe and are also confused by the blandness comments.  We found this to be delicious and simple.  It would be easy to prepare this for a fresh, home-made weeknight dinner.  I followed the recipe and agree that butter is the way to go.  It adds such a nice flavor and texture to the broth, and is a healthier fat than margarine or cooking oil.  I also used 12 oz of non-fat evaporated milk instead of whole regular milk.  And I included the carrots ? I have eaten chowder all up and down coastal Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts and have had it both with and without.  Both are good, but I am a firm believer in there can?t be too many carrots in soup.  We served it with a salad for dinner, and there was enough chowder leftover for lunches.  To that we added some saut&eacute;ed watercress and that was a nice addition.  It didn?t affect the flavor of the chowder, but the lingering flavor was only of the watercress.  The chowder held and reheated nicely.  I put it in a saucepan on the stove very low to heat it slowly and avoid the risk of scalding the milk.",

        "Review": "This is the ideal chicken recipe for a light  meal served with a Mimosa Salad and a flute of Champagne. It would also be perfect for a picnic.or for sandwiches  The chicken is moist and lightly flavored from the wine stock..  I used Marsala wine,a close cousin to sherry and marinated (after cooking ) the chicken for 2 days in the stock in the fridge.  Because I started with skinless/boneless breasts the stock did not gel but it will be used as a base for another soup.  The recipe calls for one breast I did two but did not double the remaining ingredients - perfect. \r\n  Simple easy and tasty recipe - Thanks Troy for a recipe I will be using again & again",

I used whole chicken wings with the joints still attached but cooked in an electric frypan that was covered most of the time so it still cooked evenly. I got it to thicken OK without cornflour but was fairly generous with the amount of curry powder, although the curry blends well with the other ingredients so it wasn't too strong. Also must say it looks much better than the photo I took - that was using the camera on a cell phone.",

Next time I make it (there will be a next time!) I would scoop out some of the softened squash and mix it with the filling prior to topping with cheese. It was a nice mix of flavors, and the splash of soy sauce gave it more of a depth of flavor. ",

Although next time I will follow the recipe more closely, I did have to make a few small changes because in each case I didn't have fresh on-hand: I used dried shiitake mushrooms that I soaked and finely chopped, frozen broccoli, and dried basil (I also added some dried parsley). I didn't have walnuts so I had to omit those. I'm a vegan, so instead of using muenster, I used a vegan cheddar cheese that is made by Follow Your Heart, and instead of butter, I used a vegan margerine. The results were still amazing. I will make this again, next time with all-fresh ingredients. ",

I do not believe the combination works at all.  It would work better to pick one of the styles, instead of combining tastes that don't work well together. \r\n\r\nStuffing Style: remove the brown sugar and soy sauce, add some soft breadcrumbs, double the basil.\r\n\r\nOriental Style: substitute almonds for walnuts, remove brown sugar and basil.\r\n\r\nSweet Style: remove soy sauce and basil.

I'm really astonished at how good it tastes!  I only had swiss so that's what I used... still good.  The second time I made it, I didn't have anymore mushrooms so I subbed some shredded zucchini, and had run out of walnuts as well. It was just as good though! I recommend mixing the shredded cheese in a little not just topping it, only thing I do differently!",

He reported back (quite surprised) that he really enjoyed it and asked me if I had used one of my faux sausages as the savory filling.  I explained it was a mushroom/broccoli/walnut stuffing that tasted so good.  The only modification I made was to use about half of the brown sugar called for, as I am wary of things being too sweet.  This seemed to be perfect for us.  I will definitely be making this again during the Fall months.  Thanks for a keeper!",

I didn&#039;t have broccoli so I substituted about 1-1/2 cups of swiss chard, and let me tell you, that was an EXCELLENT choice!  I might actually do this every time.  I also had to use pecans instead of walnuts (no big deal) and I used a combination of ricotta and mozzarella instead of muenster cheese.  The cheeses were a BIG success as well.

I cut the recipe in half for 2 people & used Mrs Dash garlic/herb seas instead of lemon pepper. I am watching my calorie intake so I  cut the dressing into 1/4-believe me, it's enough for 2 wraps. I also used whole wheat tortillas & left out the lettuce. I cooked the chicken on the stovetop, too. Very filling; thank you for sharing!",

        "Review": "I'm really surprised this has never been rated!  I don't usually make things that don't have ratings.  Bad, I know, but I'm not terribly experienced and need the helpful hints.  Nonetheless, I tried this because it was a recipe with the ingredients I had on hand.  I needed to use up peaches and blueberries.  I only had 2 peaches and a small handful of blueberries, so I used a smaller dish than a 9\" pie plate.  I left the topping measurements the same, because there is no such things as too much crisp.  This was super easy and super tasty.  I'm having to stop myself from not eating the whole thing myself.",

I thought it might give a caramel taste, but it just gave a mellow flavor. I messed up and added the flour all at once rather than a bit at a time, which meant that it took a while to blend in. If you use unsalted butter, as I did, I recommend adding a pinch of salt.",

        "Review": "Very good, and mostly easy to make.  I did want a sweet cookie, so I added 1/3 cup extra sugar to a double recipe. But the dough was sticky, so I probably added an extra cup of sugar. Not sure if that was because I doubled the recipe or not. The end result was still delicious! I baked at 325 for approx. 10-12 minutes, until quite browned on edges. They stay sort of soft until completely cool, when they become crispy. Next time I would like to shorten the baking time so they're not so brown- I believe they would still be crispy. I used cookie cutters, did not prick with fork, and half-dipped the final product in melted chocolate. Yummy!",

These were easy to make even for a novice such as myself.  It took much less than 25 minutes to bake though more like 10-12 minutes.  They tasted sweet enough on their own in my opinion, but I did jazz them up by drizzling white and semi-sweet chocolate over them.",

        "Review": "Very easy to make and doesn't take a long time either. I have a fan-assisted oven and my cookies were done in just under 10 minutes at the specified temperature- so be aware and don't let them burn! I didn't have time to bake the whole batch so wrapped half in cling film/ saran wrap and used it the next day (after letting it soften to room temperature) and it worked just fine after being kept overnight. Thanks for a lovely recipe!",

        "Review": "Wow, this is one tasty shortbread! It's very easy to work with and has a great flavour. But next time I'll definitely reduce the amount of butter used by 1-1.5 tbs because as you can see from my pics the dough was so buttery that the fingers lost their shape while baking. Also I'd add some salt (1/2 ts).\r\nOther than that very very nice.\r\nThanks for sharing, Ceezie!",

        "Review": "This was great. My first attempt at shortbread. I thought it would be a complex recipe. Nope. It's easier than pie. (he he) I baked this in my Pampered Chef stoneware heart molds. Parfaitment! I followed the recipe exactly. Had to increase the time slightly because the molds were a little bigger/deeper. The shortbread was just sweet enough, perfect texture. I wish I could tell you how they store, how long they'll keep at room temperature, but, alas, they did not hang around all that long. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you, Nancy!",

        "Review": "re: Storage Just figured I'd share a storage tip. If you've ever heard of a Brown-Sugar Bear, it works on the same principle. I got a Brown Sugar Bear in a kitchen-specialty shop/probably available on line. It's a molded piece of clay pottery (just like plants in clay pots)... The directions were to soak the Brown Sugar bear in water for 20 minutes - and afterwards, dry it off and place it in your bag of brown sugar - it literally keeps the brown sugar pliable...so you never ever have to throw away the rock-hard brown sugar. If you should ever find your brown sugar getting hard, you repeat the soaking process and your hard brown sugar will soften again by storing it with the Brown Sugar Bear. Now, as far as cookie storage, you could either get another brown sugar bear, or you can just head down to Lowes or Home Depot and get a clay saucer - the small one will suffice. Just be sure it's never been used and that it's clean/free of debris (but do NOT use soap: just rinse it off. Then soak it just like a Brown Sugar Bear for 20 minutes... and then dry it off and tuck it in the bag with your cookies - whether these shortbread or any fresh cookies (our friend gives trays of home made cookies at Christmas, and they always go stale before we get to the last ones, but I remember my Brown Sugar Bear and used a clay saucer soaked in water as I've said and they stay wonderfully fresh! You won't be disappointed, trust me. My hubby delivers a nationally known brand of cookies, so we are somewhat cookie snobs, usually preferring his brand -vs- home made, but ever since we've employed the Brown Sugar Bear clay-soaked pottery trick, we've learned to appreciate home-made cookies as fresh as the day they were made!",

I really wanted to like this because Julesong always makes such good stuff.  I'm sorry to say that it didn't turn out so good.  Although the spinach mix was good, with a cup of breadcrumbs it wasn't a bold enough taste to carry the dough surrounding it.  I did make some adjustments:  pumped up the parmesan and slightly decreased the breadcrumbs.  My husband and son turned up their noses as the nutmeg, though I thought it was an interesting addition.  It did make a great picture.",

I actually had it for breakfast. \r\nDH came home with a huge amount of yellow squash, so I doubled the marinade. In making the marinade, I substituted Splenda for the sugar, used white wine instead of wine vinegar, & 10 or 12 cloves of garlic. I shared part of the squash recipe with a friend who also thought it was fantastic. Try this, you are going to love it!!!",

I use Splenda and first mix it with the cider vinegar before adding the rest of the ingredients including red wine vinegar in the marinade.  I also use red instead of green pepper (personal preference) in the overall ingredients.  Thank you, Peppermintkitty!",

Then I placed them on a greased cookie sheet, brushed them with olive oil and a little bit of salt and broiled them until the skins were crispy.  I served them with the sauce as listed in the recipe, which I made early and let sit for a while so the flavors could meld.\r\nI made these with fried chicken, green beans and biscuits... thank you!! :)",

I was going to halve the recipe because there are only 2 of us but since there was only 1/2 cup left in the jar I used it all.  I'm glad I did, I can't wait to use it again!",

        "Review": "I'm sure mine didn't turn out the way intended, as I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces (since I don't like large bites of potato). Then, on top of doing that, I left them in the water after boiling, until I was ready for them, (I knew all along what the result might be, based on the things I was doing lol). I considered posting my result on here as a new recipe, but realized that really, it's still the same recipe, with a slight variation, so others can choose which way they're in the mood for, each time they make it. What happened was that as I was mixing everything together, yes, go figure, the potatoes started falling apart. So, I ended up with something between mashed potatoes & potato salad, only far more garlicky, but very good. Oh, & I did add a tad of dried dill, sweet basil & white pepper. My son had wanted hamburgers, but I didn't want to serve the typical chips, or fries or macaroni & cheese with them, so when I found this recipe I thought it would be a nice fit, a little less plain. I also served it with my Caribbean Coleslaw recipe (#290325) which was nice & light which helped balance out the garlic flavor. For desert I served my Rocky Road Chocolate Mousse (#286486) which was nice, because it was cool & light, & we could each choose how much we wanted, I only had a little because by that time I was very full (duh).  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe that was simple and apparently infallible lol!",

This is very easy to make - I just wing the quantities when cooking for myself - as I'd eat four servings if they were in front of me. Also, I add a splash of sherry vinegar, which adds a little acidity to the dish. 4/23/2015",

Perfect time of year for apple anything, and the oats and brown sugar go so well together.  I think I could justify eating this for breakfast. Thanks for the recipe. Oh, I used closer to ten apples, but they were on the smallish side.",

I substituted lime juice instead of lemon, and I didn't have enough topping for a 9\"x13\" pan, but I quickly and easily whipped up a second batch in my food processor to cover the rest of the pan. (Reason for this could be that I was eating it while slicing apples :) ) I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and warm caramel syrup drizzled over the top. I also sprinkled some cinnamon over the ice cream and garnished with cinnamon sticks. Delicious!",

I am not sure what they are, but they are small, tart and crispy.  I also used lime instead of apple juice.  I used vegan margarine in this as well as my DH and I don't eat dairy products.

I thought while I was making it that I should spice up the topping, which would still be tasty, but leaving it without the extra spices let the flavor of the nuts come through. I did use pecans rather than walnuts simply because my inlaws have a pecan tree and that's what I have! Delicious!",

She only uses 4 c apples ( I think because we enjoy more topping) and doesn't use lemon juice or walnuts, but I think I will try it next time!  She also uses an 8x8 dish.

        "Review": "I made this for a dessert with my sister. We really enjoyed it. I added a touch of vanilla to the apple and lemon juice mixture. Excellent! We topped it with vanilla ice cream. Delicious! I will be making this again. I also cut down on the butter but next time I may add 5 tablespoons to the topping instead of 4 tablespoons. Awesome recipe!",

I think next time if served as a sandwich I would dice up the chunks and the ham pieces and celery into smaller bits. If served over lettuce it is just fine the way it is. When you chill it for several hours it tastes one way-very Hawaiian and when you let it warm up while serving you can really taste the olives. Both ways were winners. I served as I said on mini croissants with grape bunches for a great snack. On mini croissants it served 6, Thanks for posting Jellyq! Enjoy. ChefDLH",

        "Review": "These are lovely cookies, tasting of pure hazelnut and butter, with no vanilla, cinnamon or other flavors to get in the way. (I do like vanilla and cinnamon in other things.) I used my food processor to chop the hazelnuts and also to mix the dough, so it was very easy. The dough was very soft - which worried me a little - but after spending the night in the refrigerator, it was quite easy to roll out and bake. The cookies spread a little, but generally held the cutout shapes. Thank you very much for posting this wonderful recipe.",

I didn't have orange rind, but I used ground cloves in the spice mix.\r\nFor the pecan topping, I didn't have any dark corn syrup, so I doubled the brown sugar (I used dark) with a tbl. milk, and vanilla instead of maple flavoring (didn't have that either!).\r\nBut it is SO GOOD and easy!  Just added this to my cookbook, it's a keeper!!  Thanks, Sharon for an excellent recipe!",

It is my belief, and only my belief, veggies in a frittata should be crisp tender.  Hope you don't mind that I took some liberty with this recipe.  I sliced the squash thin and added some green onions and red bell pepper.  Cooked the onion and bell pepper for a few minutes in a lightly buttered cast iron skillet, added the squash and cooked to wilt.  Poured the eggs mixture of egg substitute mixed with 1 tablespoon crème fraiche, black pepper and Italian seasoning over the veggies.  Cooked, lifting egg to allow the uncooked portion to go to the bottom of the pan.  When eggs were almost set, I topped them off with freshly grated parmesan cheese and placed under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  The family enjoyed this served with fresh biscuits.",

It's also better cut into rings instead of diced small, for texture. He used egg subsitute and omitted the cheese to knock off all that cholesterol, so this was much healthier. This made a delicious satisfying brunch for him.",

I added alittle celery seed to the batter for alittle extra flavor. \r\nI thought I made a review for this but don't see it listed so I am adding another. \r\nI shared a few puffs with a friend and she just had to have the recipe, she loved them too. This is a keeper!! Thanks for posting a neat way to use squash. ",

So since I already had the recipe started I just added some extra flour.  Needless to say, the puffs were pretty doughy on the inside. Maybe it would be better with the cornmeal. I may try again another time.",

        "Review": "I would probably call these fritters more than puffs, but they were delicious no matter what you call them! I loved them on their own, but I also tried this mixture as a batter for deep-fried zucchini and it is great for that, too. The main key there is not to put too much batter on the zucchini because the corn flavor can kind of overpower the zucchini. ",

In the second batch we cut the cornmeal with breadcrumbs which lightened it up some and added southwestern ingredients like finely chopped jalapeno and green onion, garlic powder, cayene pepper, paprika and cumin.  We just put enough dough for one or two in separate bowl and everyone added what they thought would be good.  We also had various dipping sauces available.  The southwestern flavors dipped in ranch won the day. Thanks riffraff for a good recipe using up some of the garden squash as well as a couple of hours entertainment for the family.",

        "Review": "Just made these and they remind me of potato latkes or pancakes.  They were quite tasty, but I really try to avoid frying, and that is the only criticism I have.  I wonder if spraying a broiler pan with Pam and putting them in the oven would work?  Maybe I'll try that the next time I want to make these when I have an extra supply of squash.  A friend dropped off a box (maybe 100 small squash)and I chose a bunch of Zaar yellow squash recipes that appealed to me.  The only problem is that I still have half a box left!  I already made three different recipes which I plan to rate, but there is a limit to how much one can eat......In putting the recipe together, I used a Vita Mix machine to mash the squash and mix all the ingredients.  I just chopped the onion roughly, and the machine did the rest.  It makes one life a lot easier.  Thank you riffraff for the tasty and savory recipe.",

I enjoyed the moist texture but will add sweet corn kernels to give it more of a hushpuppie-like\" taste.  I will also do a teaspoon size dollop, should cook through more evenly, I think.  A great way to use the plethera of yellow squash I have in my freezer from this summers garden!",

I took a Pillsbury crust from the freezer and let it defrost while we searched.  We came across this one and he decided instantly that it was what he wanted.  We really enjoyed it, but thought that there was not enough sweet potato filling.  Next time we'd double the sweet potato part and leave the pecan topping the same.  It really is the best of both worlds, though!",

Secondly I left out completely the sugar in the top layer and used only the corn syrup.  The results a lower carb version and less sweet.  I was recieved rave reviews and a thanks giving a less sweet option.",

I added more of each spice, used brown sugar instead of white, and half corn syrup/half maple syrup (recommended by another reviewer).  While the filling wasn't super-shallow in the pie dish, I would agree with other's recommendations to double/increase the filling.  This is such a good pie you're going to want more of it anyways!",

First, I knew that I should have left out the black olives, as itâ€™s not a favorite in our house, but I wanted to follow the recipe exactly.  Second, the vinegar mixed with the jalapeno juice just doesn't give it the best zing.  I think a better option would be lime juice and fresh jalapeno or serrano peppers.  I do love the variety of veggies in the salad though.",

I also substituted canola oil for the butter since DH is trying to watch his fat intake. DH does not like things syrupy sweet. This pie had the perfect balance of sweetness spice and everything nice. Thank you for submitting this wonderful pie.",

The great thing about it is that you can add some things and leave out others without changing the goodness.  If I don't have olives, I just leave them out.  If I have something extra, I add it.  I have made it every w/e for a month and it has remained in demand.  I bet it would be great with cucumbers, but I was outvoted on trying it.  Thanks!",

        "Review": "Great recipe but I will make some minor alterations in the cooking temperature and times next time I fix it.  The ingredients don't need to be altered, in my opinion, just the cooking directions.  I made two batches of biscotti, this recipe first and then a batch of lemon-ginger biscotti from the cookbook that came with my food processor.  I followed the directions exactly on both batches and this batch was overcooked for the first baking which made it to dry and it was very crumbly when i was trying to cut it before the second baking.  The other recipe didn't cook quite as long and at a lower temperature for the first baking and turned out beautiful--it looked like a professional had made it.  The alterations I will make are as follows:  For the first baking bake at 325 degrees for 22 minutes.  Remove from the oven cool only for 10 minutes and then cut at 1/2\" intervals (this made it easier to cut and each biscotti was perfectly shaped).  Arrange slices on the baking sheet (cut sides exposed) and bake for 20 to 25 minutes until they begin to turn golden and crispy.  I turned them once through that baking even though the recipe didn't require it.  Enjoy!!!",

        "Review": "Sooo good! I only had semi sweet chocolate so I used that in place of the white. We really loved them, and they're not overly sweet. I even sneaked a piece before the second baking, and it was like a soft cookie. After the last baking, it was crunchy, and very good dunked into a big glass of cold milk.",

This was great!\r\n\r\nOnly modification:  I didn't have any white baking bits so I used nearly 2x the chocolate chips called for.  Yum!!  I like chocolate better anyway...\r\n\r\nWould probably be even better with 1 tsp of instant coffee granules mixed in to enhance the chocolate flavor.  Will try that next.",

Also, I chilled the dough before baking, as it made it easier to shape it. I also added slivered almonds and dried cranberries and instead of putting the white chocolate in the dough, I melted it and drizzled it on after baking and cooling. I put these in jars and intend to give them away as Christmas presents.  Thanks for an easy and great recipe!",

I left mine out after cooling for an addtional 2 hours (covered by some parchment paper) before storing and this resulted in the perfect crispness for dunking in coffee. I shared some with friends but will be making another batch to stash in the freezer for future indulgences. Thanks Nancy Van Ess.  **Edit - I made the second batch and used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa (a blend of natural and dutched cocoa) and was amazed that this recipe could have even more flavor - and the color was intense too.",

        "Review": "These spaetzle are delicious.  This recipe makes a lot... at least 8 servings.  We are two adults and two small kids and next time I will use 1/3rd of this recipe.  Also, I found pushing through a strainer too hard (I don't have a press); however, I tried using a knife to push the dough through the slits in a pancake flipper and that seemed to work OK.",

It made enough for about 6-8 people, so i sauteed half of them in butter and salt, and topped those with the chicken and used the other half for chicken and dumplings.  These are the perfect chewy consistency, just like I was looking for.\nThanks for sharing your recipe!",

Tastes great in soup or as a substitute for potatoes as a side dish. Saut&eacute; in melted butter or margarine with a little salt and sprinkle with Parmesan Cheese. My son used leftover spaghetti sauce over the top, though I have not yet tried that.",

        "Review": "As a German National, growing up in the birthplace of Spaetzle in the Swabian community, having had Spaetzle twice a week since I can remember, I have to tell you that Spaetzle are not made with milk. You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal.",

My spaetzle maker is not a potato ricer. It has large holes. (like little dumplings). DH and I like them fried in butter. We had them cooked this way at a German resturant once and it's the only way we like to eat them now!  Thanks, Melody for posting.",

Better to put a few raisins & nuts in at a time and grind. Also, it didn't set. So I pried it out of the pan & rolled it in 32 balls instead. I rolled the balls in a total of 1 c. sweetened coconut that I had colored red. That said, these are a cool texture, and the perfect mix of salty and sweet. A great \"healthier\" addition to a cookie platter. I would have been perfectly happy giving them 5 stars if I had known from the beginning that I would be rolling them into balls. (My blender is fine, BTW <blush>)",

Saute onions in 2 Tbsp oil  and 2 Tbsp butter, over moderate heat, until they are soft and lightly colored  (about 8 minutes). Add mush- rooms and saute. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste,  wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar.\", \"Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered,  for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it  cool completely.\", \"Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 1/8 to 1/4  inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes.\", \n\"Now make the  Bechamel Sauce.  NOTE:  The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest  (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny  bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set aside.\", \"Melt the butter in 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and  still being careful not to let it brown.\", \n\"Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings.\", \"Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated.\", \"Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides.\", \"Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs.\", \n\"Place a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg. F for  one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top.\", \"Remove moussaka from  oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the layers to  fuse.\", \"\")",

I do alter it a bit though - I add about 1 lb of ground lamb and use only 1 cup of mushrooms. I also bake the eggplant with olive oil at 350 for 10-12 min (as per Mean Chef recipe #29381). It is SO amazing even my super petite friend weighing in at only 100lbs gos back for seconds! Thanks Barbara!",

Did add ground meat along with the mushrooms. Started this the day before browning stove top then finished in the crock pot. Made the Bechamel in the microwave. First melted in a large glass bowl added the flour stirred till smooth, added the milk and microwaved till thick. Mixed the eggs and ricotta together till smooth and then added to the sauce. I would next time use 1 cup less milk. I had a lot left over that would have overfilled the pan.  Didn`t have parm so I use mozzarella cheese. I do think the parm would be the better choice. I also had to bake an additional 20 minutes. Rising the temperature to 350 should do the trick to bake for 45-60 minutes. Thanks for the good eats! ;)",

The moussaka seemed a little sweet the first day, but thought the sweetness lessened and flavor improved the second.  I would consider making this a day ahead and reheating.  The 3 inch deep dish is a must, as I had to use less of the bechamel sauce.",

I used the ricotta as its own layer and folded in about a cup of crumbled Bulgarian feta and topped the pan with the Bechamel over  a layer of shredded mozzarella.

(but I think it was from using the white choc)It was easy to make. My husband has had two pieces already. I will try and do it again in the proper size pan. I used an 8 x 8 and it took twice as long to bake, and was to thick. . But that was my own fault. Thanks for sharing  Next time I will do as I was told and use unsweetened choc. lol",

I didn't have a clue what a \"moderately low\" oven temperature was, I went and read some other carrot cake recipes to see what the average cooking temperature was and used 375 degrees F.  The cake was dry and overcooked.  I didn't have a ring pan so I used a square one.  That is my fault, not hers.  It tasted like it'd be good but it's hard to tell with an over baked, dry bread.  Sorry, I wouldn't make this again.",

My cake turned out moist and good.",

I also used tomatoes from the garden and normal onion, as that's what I had, and it still tasted good. If i had been thinking I would've cut the tomatoes into wedge slices or bigger bite size pieces... because it said chopped, I cut the tomatoes into smaller pieces.  Also I imagine that goat cheese would do very well in this salad. after i cut the tomatoes I noticed lots of juice as mine were seedy, so I strained them before adding in the liquids.",

I sprinkled sugar on top of the crust for a nice sweet crunchy topping. The finished product smelled fabulous, with the berry juices just bubbling away inside the crust. A nice subtle undertone of cinnamon and lemon peel adds zing to the pie! A real winner! Thanks!",

This is a great pie, and definitely superior to any other blueberry pie recipe I have tried before.  The addition of cinnamon and nutmeg, along with the lemon rind, made it extra delicious. I used the Most Incredible No Fail Pie Crust Recipe #28943 and it was terrific with this pie. The only adjustments I made the second time I made it were to add one additional cup of blueberries and to omit the margarine.  It was just fine without the margarine and the extra berries just made it a bit fuller. Will be putting this in the forever book.",

I thought about throwing out the juice but wanted its flavor.  I originally cut this while still hot and was a little disappointed, but once it cooled and set all its flavor came out.  Good taste and not too sweet.  Very enjoyable.",

Fast forward seven months, and I took the pie filling out of the freezer, defrosted it, plopped it into a Pillsbury pie crust (frozen since Christmas), and voila! We had a scrumptious blueberry pie for Easter dinner!  This was very good.  Not too sweet, but sweet enough!  I'll definately make this again!!",

I used frozen blueberries with 1 tbsp added cornstarch which worked out fine, the major problem was that the flour mix never encorporated into the pie. It just got gooey. So I'm not sure I would use the full amount again, maybe only 1/2.",

This recipe is awesome - couldn't wait for the pie to completely cool to have a slice!  Now can't wait to have a slice once it has set - the combo of flavors with those fresh blueberries is amazing.  I also threw in about a cup of chopped strawberries that I had in the fridge - did I mention it is yummy? :) Will definitely be making this again!",

        "Review": "This pie is amazing. My husband requested blueberry pie for Father's Day. He normally doesn't like desserts, but absolutely loved this pie. The only change I made was to add some cornstarch (even though I used fresh berries). The cinnamon, nutmeg and lemon combination is so good and adds a lot of depth to the berries. Thank you so much!",

The lime seemed unusual, but brightened the flavor so much.  Overall, these were good, but contained too much of a good thing...and I LOVE pistachio.",

        "Review": "This made very good, crunchy crisp biscotti, perfect with coffee. They are not real sweet cookies, which is how I prefer them. Because of the limits of my oven, I baked the biscotti in two 9-inch long loaf pans, which I had greased and floured. The dough was pretty sticky, but since I didn't attempt to form it there was no problem. My short loaves baked in the 30 minutes given, I then sliced them and baked again as the recipe states. My yield was 35 biscotti after trimming the ends of the loaves. I haven't used the chocolate, and probably would reduce the amount if I did. Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

I skipped the glaze and just threw in a few chocolate chips, which worked well.  I also substituted hazelnuts with pecans.  This is a good recipe.",

Would advise mixing sugar and rhubarb at least 15 minutes before starting the rest of the recipe, this gives the fruit (or is it a veggie, never did get that straight) time to and sugar time to develop some nice juice.",

Not sweet, so it might be better for those who really don't like sweet desserts.  Maybe with a little less sugar and a bit of lemon juice it might taste tart and that might make it a bit more interesting.\n\nThanks for posting.

        "Review": "Absolutely delicious. Very moist.  I let the rhubarb set with 1/2 c sugar for 15 minutes to give the fruit and sugar time to develop some juice.  I then lessened the sugars to another 1/4 c white sugar and only 1/2 c brown sugar.  Instead of shortening (only cause I didn't have any) I used margarine.  Followed the rest of the recipe. The batter seemed dry and sticky and hard to spread when I put it in the pan but it came out perfect and moist.  It was done in 40 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

It's a nice cross between a cake and a cookie bar.  We all agreed that the addition of walnuts or pecans would be really nice too...",

        "Review": "I made these for a potluck tomorrow and they turned out wonderfully! I love rhubarb so I would have liked more rhubarb flavor out of them but to serve to others (most of whom probably aren't as big fans of rhubarb as I am) I think this is a wonderful combination of sweet and (just a bit) tart. They are somewhere between a cake and a bar and I think next time I make them, I may use more rhubarb in hopes of getting more 'juice' and making them more solid and bar-like. Either way, these are delicious and a wonderful way to enjoy my rhubarb!",

The surrounding batter was definitely sweet enough to handle it - I'm really surprised at folks who described this recipe as \"not sweet\"... I also used butter instead of shortening.",

        "Review": "My husband and I lived in Malaysia for 4 years and became WELL acquainted with the local food.  We loved Gado-Gado which is Indonesian but the Malay love it also and it is seen on many restaurant menus throughout the country.  Southeast Asians normally peel their cucumbers but since we hae returned to living in the states I DON'T, not only because of the nutrient value, but also it adds color to the salad.  I also add shredded carrots to the salad for the same reason but keep the rest of the veggies most like how it was served in Malaysia and Indonesia. <3  The secret to having the BEST Gado-Gado is the fresh peanut sauce that is used as the dressing.  If making it fresh isn't your thing, try using Bangkok Padang Peanut Sauce found in your local Safeway store in the Ethic region.  It's the most like the Indonesian/Malay sauce served with this salad.  MOST recipes in Malaysia include Tofu cut into small cubes, dusted in cornstarch and fried up in a wok and then added on top of the salad just before serving.  It's wonderful!!  Thanks for this recipe Carol H!",

I used the fresh rosemary and I think I will cut it down a little next time I make this.The rosemary was a bit strong for us,but this was a very good way to fix potatos.I loved the great lemon and garlic combo!  Lots of flavor.I will also cut my potatos a little smaller as I think I made them too large a dice.Thanks for a good recipe!I will make this again. ",

The only suggestion I might make (in order to make them more authentically Greek) is to parboil for ten to fifteen minutes first and then cover them with foil when cooking so that they don't get crispy.

The only possible change I'd make is to increase the amount of red peppers for a little more 'heat'. Also, you can omit the rice, and drink this as a wonderful lentil soup. It's great for when you have a really bad cold, and need something to warm you up. Thanks for sharing this one... I'm sooo gonna make it over and over!",

I modified by cooking in pressure cooker for about 10 minutes at high pressure.  I allowed the guests to add more heat by having Thai spicy sauce on the side.  A DEFINITE WINNER!",

Right amount of Tumeric, the sauce is excellent, the basmati rice and lentils are filling - would make again in a second. ",

I usually use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and double the ginger. I serve with basmati rice, a big dollop of plain yoghurt, and microwaved pappadums. I sometimes partially puree this. I usually use red lentils, but see in the pictures some people have used brown. Might try that for something different! ",

        "Review": "This was my first time making Dhal, although it&#039;s one of my favorite Indian dishes. This recipe is easy to follow with simple ingredients which are easy to find at most grocery stores. I made one change: I used vegetable broth instead of water and I think it helped add to the flavor of the dish. Warning: this dish is mild, as it&#039;s supposed to be. It&#039;s great served with a spicy main (I served it with a very hot chicken tikka masala &amp; some rice). Over-all good but I think I will add more cauliflower next time.",

I use ground cumin, frozen cauliflower florets, canned diced tomatoes and add 1 tsp of veggie Better than Bouillon to the water. I also let it cook on med-high for 15-20 minutes and the lentils turn out nice and mushy like at restaurants. I rave about this recipe to everyone I know.",

        "Review": "Excellent crepe recipe!  I am no pro when it comes to crepes, but these were a complete success.  I didn't refrigerate the batter and it did fine using right away.  I used a 10\" skillet, sprayed with nonstick spray.  It also helped to spray my spatula for flipping.  I held these in a baking dish in a warm oven as they came off the heat - and I sprayed between the crepes so they wouldn't stick together.  (Whole lotta sprayin' going on!)  I got 12 crepes.  Filled with a savory curry chicken.  Super good; I'd definitely use this recipe again!!",

How much butter? How high should the heat be? How much batter per crepe? Well, we used butter, on a heavy bottom pan, medium high heat and made them very thin. Kept them warm in the oven until they were all done. This recipe made about 15 crepes.",

Years later, I finally decided to attempt to make this.  Again, I really love Mississippi Mud Pie, but this particular recipe was OK 4 me.  Maybe I didn&#039;t thoroughly mix 2gether the flour and nut (for base crust). I found there were pieces that tasted more flour than nut.  I think this is a lot of work....I guess if the craving strikes again, I may make this again.",

        "Review": "Someone already posted this wasn’t Mississippi Mud. They are 100% correct. While there are variations, a true traditional Mississippi Mud always has marshmallow creme. This is a quick delicious layered Jello pudding pie. I’ve made it since the 90’s. It’s also delicious using Pistschio pudding. You can also use lemon pudding using a lemon pie recipe. All flavors are great for summer events. My daughter actually made this and told me she made Mississippi Mud. I told her sorry but it’s not. I can’t believe people misname or rename things wrongly but maybe they accidentally didnt really know. I told my daughter I would be embarrassed for her if she served this Jello recipe (which is delicious too) and called it Mississippi Mud out in public. Yes, I’m old and 50. I just want the younger generation to know the difference. Don’t take this wrong. Thanks so much. Amber",

I made a long distance move, and my cookbooks, along with the book I had this recipe written in, wound up in storage! I haven't located my cookbooks yet, and couldn't remember the complete recipe. Now I can finally make my dessert again!!! My family and friends absolutely love this dessert any time of the year!!! I agree with another reviewer, that this stuff is so light and so tastey, you could easily over eat!!!",

        "Review": "This really was a delicious and different recipe.  I used egg substitute with good success and added a bit of fresh rosemary to the cakes as I love the combination of rosemary with blue cheese. I had concern with the cake holding together while making, but it was not a problem, and refridgerating the batter I'm sure helped. This recipe is one that can be very versatile, and I can see making it with other combinations such as feta with oregano & kalamata olives or asiago with basil and garlic. The sauce while simple complimented the cakes and next time as a personal preference I may use red wine in the sauce rather than white.  Great meatless meal for vegetarians or side dish to simple broiled fish or chicken.  Thank you Strawberry Girl for sharing the recipe.",

A good base, but if I made it again I would jazz it up a bit - the feta/kalamatta combo suggested by BonnieZ sounds good.  The sauce was simple and tasty, left overs were good on pasta for lunch next day.  Thanks",

        "Review": "I tried this recipe out in two batches for Christmas gifts.  The first batch I made my own dried orange peel by scrapping the zest off a couple of mandarin oranges, then letting it dry overnight on a cake rack with paper towel on it (when it was dry it crushed easily in your fingers).  I made a second batch without the orange and liked it just as much (and it took a fraction of the time). I doubled the sugar though so it tasted more sweet than bitter.  Great recipe!",

I really like the fact that this is sweetened with honey rather than sugar- it gives it a bit of a unique taste, plus I subscribe to the idea that natural sweeteners like honey, are better for you than white sugar, so that's nice too!  Good proportion of coffee to milk and certainly very easy!  I did find it a smidge sweet for my taste.  Next time I would reduce the honey, but I do typically take my coffee with just milk or cream.  Thanks for the recipe!  It made a lovely refreshing pick-me-up without the price of Starbucks.",

To add some flavor, I brewed the coffee with a cinnamon stick and a tiny cap ful of Torani vanilla syrup. When I first tasted this, I thought the honey was really over powering and this tasted almost like a super strong tea. I added one truvia packet to my cup and that made it a little better - but I think next time I'll skip the honey all together and just use truvia. Thanks for sharing!",

It's a terrific, very easy salmon recipe, even without the sesame seeds -- I have always left out the sesame seeds only because I never have any in the house.  The longer you marinate the salmon, the better it tastes.  I have marinated it for as little as an hour and as long as 24 hours and it always tastes great, but longer is better.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Enjoy!",

The salmon was marinated for 3 hours and for the piece of fish that we had, the cooking time was not nearly enough.  The fish ended up having to be baked for about 10 minutes to get it cooked through.  Some of the problem with this may have been user error.  We will probably not have this again as my husband does not believe that salmon and maple are flavors that should be mixed.",

The only thing I hope to see addressed is the missing portion of soy sauce- the ingredient list calls for a 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and the recipe instructions only calls for a 1/6 cup.  Which is correct?   Well, I used the full 1/4 cup and it came out fine, but I suggest that this error is corrected.  Nonetheless, I plan to make this marinade many times for many dishes.",

        "Review": "What a great way to cook salmon. Though I admit to have fried it as well and I followed Fredricks advise to leave it marinate a bit longer. (I also didn't use sesame, just forgot :)) For some reason it got to stay in the marinade for 48 hrs. I used half of one side of salmon, but the same amount of marinade. It looked quite impressive when it came out of the pan. If you just use pieces of salmon filet, you might want use 2 per person, because you will come back for more. I served it with rice and a corn-cucumbersalsa. It's easy and quick to make and will be eaten by todlers too. We have salmon on sale at the moment, so I'll be heading back to buy some more and cook it again!!! Delicious! Thanks for sharing.",

I followed as directed, using FRESH caught Alaskan Salmon from my Dad's fishing trip. Perhaps this would have been better on the grill, where I do most of our cooking.  It was kinda boring and a tad dry without much flavor.  I also marinated for 4 hours. Sorry.... net time BBQ!",

        "Review": "Wonderful and very easy.  I generally do not like long marinating times for fish, so the only adjustment I made (aside from using an entire side of salmon) was to decrease the marinating time to about 15 minutes.  I let the filets sit in the marinade for just the time it took the broiler to pre-heat.  Even increasing the amount of salmon, I had enough marinade, I didn't brush the salmon with extra sauce, and it was perfect for us.  Flavorful, but not overbearing.",

        "Review": "This was very good and super easy. I cant say enough about how easy this was. (Total cooking time maybe 15 minutes with salad already prepped.) I marinated 2 pieces of salmon for about 8 hours. One piece was larger and thicker than the other. My wife who is not a salmon lover (trying to convince her :), said the small piece was excellent but the larger piece still seemed fishy to her. It was fine for me and my 9 year old son! So like other posters I would agree with a longer marinade time being better. Or maybe next time I will use a vacuume canister for marinade! That said I was using store bought frozen packaged salmon not fresh caught. (sigh) I did use the sesame seeds and they are a perfect compliment to the soy sauce in the recipe. They add a nuttiness that goes perfect with the saltiness of the soy sauce. I had baked potato's left over from the night before, but did'nt want to serve baked potato's again. So I sliced them about 1/4 to 5/8's thick, and in a medium hot skillet with about 3-4 Tbl spoons olive oil I lightly fried the rounds about 4-5 mins then flipped. They were perfectly golden. Just before the second side was done I added a little shredded cheddar to each one (not smothered just a little) and covered them so the cheese would melt. I plated them, put a dot of sour cream in the center of each and garnished with fresh chives. They were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. They went over huge! OMG perfect dish salmon, potato's and salad! My son wanted to know why we were eating so fancy lol!",

I may play with the seasonings and try it again, but I find salmon a tad expensive for experimentation so I can't be certain about that.",

I added a bit of chili powder to the fillet to add a bit of complexity/spice.  \n\nMy only frustration was the unpleasant odor and mess of the sauce, some of which inevitably drips off and burns on the pan in such a high temp oven.\n\nMost likely will make again anyway, as it was quite good.",

The marinade forms a coating (a layer) on the salmon that is delicious when cooked.  Instead of the sesame seeds, we have used cracked black peppercorns added after cooking for a hotter (spicy) result.  I also serve it with wilted spinach and roasted peppers and a bowl of fresh strawberries.  It's an elegant and nutritious dinner!",

I baked it in foil at 400degrees for 20 minutes and it turned out perfect.  I served it with garden beans and squash and of course a potato for DH!  I made the mistake of tossing out the excess marinade, will never do that again.  I will reduce it and drizzle it over the fillets on the plates.  This was super easy, tasted terrific and looked so beautiful.  Thank you.",

        "Review": "This was pretty tasty. I made it almost exactly as written. I had a slightly bigger (1.04 lbs.) piece of skin-on salmon, which I cut in half, then marinated for about 3 hours. Since I was using up a bottle of sesame seeds, I probably used about 1 tsp. per piece. I'm not sure I've ever broiled anything before, and was pretty unsure of the technique (mainly distance from the flame), but guess I did okay. I think I didn't reduce the sauce enough, though. Still, this was a fairly elegant recipe, though I didn't serve it with the fancy accompaniments suggested - just corn. I just might try this recipe again!",

        "Review": "I really liked how easy this dish was. I could use all ingredients already in my pantry. The hardest part for a low-maintenance cook like me is marinating the fish ahead of time, but even that was pretty low-investment. I marinated the meat for about two hours on each side (flipping the salmon over half-way through because I was using a smaller container and had to fold the fish in half.)<br/><br/>I used the extra marinade once cooked over yellow squash and this is the kind of recipe where it will work with pretty much anything.<br/><br/>Note that the times should be switched above. Prep time is 2 1/4 hours, cook time is around 10 min.<br/><br/>Make sure you're not too stingy on oiling the pan or it will burn on juices which makes it tougher to clean.<br/><br/>Also I highly recommend serving with a wedge of fresh lemon. When you squeeze it on the finished entree it adds another dimension to the flavor which actually heightens the sweetness of the maple marinade.<br/><br/>Next time I'd love to try with some garlic and/or green onions as some of the other reviewers suggested. I added garlic salt to taste.",

        "Review": "We stuck quite close to the recipe, and the 2 of us gave it mixed reviews.  I thought the flavors were marvelous, and would easily award 4 stars.  The blend of tarragon, thyme and rosemary in the breading is sublime; it's the first time I've ever liked anything with tarragon, possibly because we used fresh not dried.  We substituted about half the oil in the vinaigrette with white wine instead, and I thought it tasted a bit like commercial salad dressing; no idea if that's due to the substitution.  I thought it might have been brighter if it used fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead of rice wine vinegar.  The horseradish in the breading practically disappears, but that's a hazard of cooking horseradish; it's always strongest uncooked.  Our big change was that we left our 1.3 lb salmon fillet whole w/ skin on the back, seared both sides, but only breaded the skinless side.  We baked 20 min, and it was still cold raw in the middle.  So then we cut into smaller fillets and broiled about 7 minutes and it was finally done just right.  My SO didn't like the breading... there was a lot of it, and we caked it on heavy since it was only on one side.  She said she might prefer a lighter breading, something Japanese-style, or only use 1c. bread crumbs.  She'd only give this 2 or grudgingly 3 stars.  Probably a recipe we'll experiment with... the herbs were wonderful!",

I also changed the layering by putting a layer of cake, berries and pastry cream in the bowl.  Then I repeated these layers.  This recipe resulted in a dessert that presents beautifully.  If you want a spectacular looking dessert to impress someone, this is it!  Wonderful layers of cake, strawberries and pastry cream all topped with whipped cream and drizzled with raspberry sauce.  The trifle was very good and the only complaint we had was that it wasn’t quite as sweet as we would have liked it to be.  After talking with Julesong about this recipe, in the future I’ll add a small amount of sugar to the strawberries before layering.  I think adding this will make the dessert truly magnificent for us.    ",

        "Review": "In my 30 years of cooking, I have never made a successful pound cake, until I tried this one!  It was lightin texture, firm tasty crust, and so, so, good!  I topped it with the strawberry glaze ID 82897 and served with whipped cream and homemade ice cream.  Divine does not begin to describe how good it was to me and my family.  I really risked making it for my daughter's birthday.  But, it was a big hit! \r\n\r\nThanks so much for this delicious recipe.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I substitued the lemon extract for lemon juice and added 1/4 cup of orange juice with the 7-Up.\r\n\r\nOh my goodness, so good I had to pray for forgiveness.",

It baked & sliced up beautifully.  \r\n\r\nBetween 2 thin slices of lightly toasted cake (cooled) I spread  cheese-colored whipped topping.  When hubby came in I announced it would be a light supper and nodded to the cold skillet the \"sandwich\" rested in.  \r\n\r\n I made a shepherd's pie to go with, coloring the potatoes pink.  It looked like strawberry cake. Next to it sat the strawberries (for the pound cake later) adding to the illusion.  \r\n\r\nFinally I pulled off an April Fool's Joke.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  \r\n\r\nI did have to made a couple of subs out of necessity.  One was usuing imitation butter extract in place of the lemon.  The other was using diet ginger ale instead of 7-up.    I was shocked when the mixture fizzed up but all turned out perfect.  I am so thankful you posted.",

        "Review": "This is one of my families favorite pound cakes. I use all butter instead of butter with shortening. I can't imagine it being better using shortening. I also add a tbsp of vanilla flavoring because we love vanilla and it gives the cake even more flavor. Lastly, I add a powered sugar glaze with 7-up and lemon vanilla in it. I have also just added powered sugar when I don't have time to make the glaze. This cakes is amazing and also sell this cake and it is one of the most requested. Add a pinch of salt to the flour. Also, I alternate the flour with the 7-up ending with flour. Most cakes use this method and I figured I would too. It absolutely works. I highly recommend this cake.",

I even used regular all purpose flour and it worked out just fine:)  When I made the first pound cake during Christmas, it was gone in 24 hours.  I made another one the next day.  It is great with or without a glaze.  I did make a glaze--absolutley delicious!!!<br/>That is why this cake has 5 stars--I give it a 10:)",

Now, I've taken it and put my spin on it -- adding a bit of red chili pepper, substituting different pastas, and adjusting the spices to my audience.  All have worked out great.  I'm making it right now on a cold, soon to be snowy night in Denver -- just what the doctor ordered.  Someone who reviewed this recipe said that it was soul-mending; I concur whole heartedly.  Someone else said it need more spice and to that person I say, \"Get a clue\".  Any recipe can easily be adjusted for spice, but it's hard to find one that offers the base for greatness.  Nancy, you've provided that for us.  Thank you!",

        "Review": "I had leftover spaghetti sauce with ground beef, onions & garlic that needed used, and we love pasta e fagioli soup, so I had to try this recipe. I halved the recipe, except for the beans (we didn’t need over 2 gallons of soup), and I wanted to use the whole cans of the beans.  The beans I used were red kidney beans, and field peas and snaps (I’d use 2 different kinds of beans again, and I didn’t drain them), we love beans, and I like the flavor of the “bean juice”?...lol).  \r\nI put everything in the crockpot the night before (except the pasta) to simplify the cooking, and so I didn’t have to worry about the vegetables being overdone. All I had to do to it when I got home from work was to cook and add the pasta, which took under 15 minutes. This  is as good or better than Olive Garden’s, and  it’s a nice hearty, satisfying  soup to come home to.  Thanks Nancy for sharing this delicious easy recipe!  We loved this with Miss Annie’sSchlotsky's Deli Bread, Recipe #20736. \r\n",

The house smelled so good when I got home.  It was exactly what I thought it would taste like.  My husband really loved it.  I halved the recipe and that still made a lot because it's just the two of us.  So I gave some to my parents and to his and they also loved it and now want the recipe.

In fact, the teachers have requested that I make it every year since then!  I usually cut the recipe in half, and sometimes start it on the stove and let it simmer in a crock pot to finish it off.  I often substitute shredded carrots for slivered, because they cook up more quickly.",

        "Review": "This recipe is Delicious!!  I made it in crockpot and home smelled great all day!  I used jar spaghetti sauce, Italian sesoning instead of the oregano and Tabasco sauce.  It's easy and inexpensive to make.  The veggies are tender.  Even using half recipe made enough for hubby & me, son and family and neighbor who mows yard for us.Am going to make 1/4 or 1/3 recipe next time.  All that is needed are some breadsticks.  We have this soup about once a week!  Thanks Nancy for great idea!",

        "Review": "Excellent soup!! My hubby is crazy about OG pasta fagioli soup & said he couldn't tell the difference except for the texture of the ground beef. A fine grind might be better. I used a garden vegetable pasta sauce, made it more interesting. I halved the recipe & it was still a good sized pot. However, the pasta turned mushy after several hours. There is not a lot of it, though, so it didn't ruin the whole soup. I would use a slight less bit of tabasco than 3/4 tsp unless you like it really hot. This soup is even better the next day!  Very yummy comfort food !!!",

        "Review": "I have never had this soup at Olive Garden, but I can say that this recipe is very good! I made the full recipe and exactly as written. I gave some large bowls of it to 3 different neighbors and still have leftovers for my lunches this week. One neighbor asked for the recipe. The next time I make it though, I will cut the pepper way down or none at all. It was pretty darn spicey, so it didn't appeal to many of the small kids. I had to cook it longer than stated to get the veggies done enough for my taste, so next time I will add the macaroni much later, as suggested by other reviewers. Thank you for a delicious soup recipe!",

Cooked all day. I chose to use less ground pepper (just 1 1/2 tsp) and used fresh Italian flat parsley, and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, instead of Tabasco. Thirty-minutes before serving, I microwaved carrots and celery for 5 minutes, adding with the pasta. Simmered until tender, while making salads. Family and friends LOVED it!

Sometimes I start it in the crock pot the night before I want to eat it the next day.  half a recipe is so perfect for my 6-quart crock pot.  I think I add extra veggies though, as I really like them.  It's more like a stoup once the pasta is added.  Serve with extra tabasco on the side for a greater kick.  The finished stuff freezes well for lunches later.",

        "Review": "Too bad we only have 5 stars, otherwise, I would have given a few more.  I agree with Nascarnurse68. Next time, I will cook longer than 45 minutes to get the carrots and celery a little more tender.  I also will add pasta toward the end of cooking so it will be \"al dente\".  In the interest of consistency, I would use the same spaghetti sauce each time.  I used Prego Traditional which worked great in this recipe.  As for stock, I use Kitchen Basics, of course! You'll make this alot this Winter.",

As a matter of fact, we had it last night, and I'm already eating a bowl today while typing this review.  Very difficult to do because I would rather eat than type.  I type a word, eat two spoonfuls and so it goes.  P.S.  I added garlic to suit our taste.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.",

We halved the recipe and came out with so much leftover.  With it being so hearty this leftover will not be in the refrigerator for more than a couple of days!  We're not chefs by any means, but this soup makes itself incredible.  Also, we were curious about what spaghetti sauce to use, and there weren't any comments on that.. so we'd like to share that we used RAGU traditional sauce. Thanks Nancy for sharing!",

I have been craving the soup and decided to make it on my own to have it for myself.  The serving is extremely large for just two, even three people, so, I cut it in half and still have a lot left over, and plenty to freeze.  I used canned marinara sauce and organic beef broth.  Very very good.",

I halved this recipe and then weighed out the portions and half of the recipe makes 8 2cup bowls of soup, this equals about 340 calories per serving.",

        "Review": "This is very close to the recipe I use. I don't use cabbage either, or the shrimp paste. Curcumae is turmeric, and it adds wonderful colour and flavour. If I'm not using a package of spice mix, I'll increase the spices to 1 teaspoon each, instead of 1/4 tsp. Fresh ginger is also very good with this. When CrinV and I make this on a large scale, to serve 60 or more people, we scramble eggs to mix through, and we also use honey garlic, or mild Italian sausage, as well as lean pork or chicken. Yum! <br/>My Update: We've now got close to 100 people to feed at our Wednesday evening dinners. We bake the rice in the oven first, at home I use a rice cooker, and I love using brown basmati. It adds terrific flavour to the dish. It's always a big hit. Thanks for posting!",

I used 50/50 plain and stoneground wholemeal flour as I prefer brown soda bread. I guess the wholemeal flour was the reason that I had to use additional buttermilk to bind it all together (about 1/4 cup). I'll defenitely be making this again! *UPDATE* I have finaly tried the recipe as it is written because I was out of wholemeal flour and just wanted to add, that it's still a great tasting soda bread, that I just can't stop eating!",

        "Review": "this bread was great.  I followed the instructions pretty much perfectly.  for buttermilk I did 2%, a dollop of plain yogurt, and about 2 tsp vinegar.  the bread was great.  the flavour was perfect- not to salty, but still flavourful.  The crumb was nice too.  a pretty heavy bread, but the type of thing that's nice with a cup of coffee and some marmalade!  mmm.  Next time I'll knead it as little as possible to make it a bit fluffier, and maybe see what happens if I don't let it sit for the 10 minutes before baking, because the crust was pretty dry, and maybe not doing that might have an affect.  Other than that, this was a great recipe and I will definitely be making this again!  thanks for an awesome recipe!",

This is the texture of the bread I remember having when I was younger on St. Patrick's Day.  Thanks for sharing! Updated 3/17/08 - Many requests again for this wonderful bread.  Quick and easy to make and so very good.  Love the texture and the crust!",

Had to leave out the cornstarch and soured some milk by adding vinegar.  Sprinkled with salt before baking.  The bread was excellent.  My housemates are raving over a simple meal of bean soup and soda bread.  Doesn't get any better than this for a cook.",

I like that it didn't have an overabundance of spices which I think really distracts from the taste of the peas. I didn't have a leek but will use next time. Also, I used the crockpot for this and it came out perfect. I browned the Kielbasa ( I used smoked sausage with cheese) and then added to soup for about the last ten minutes or so. So glad you posted this. It is the best.",

        "Review": "I tried this recipe because I had a similar recipe years ago that got misplaced. The cake was a big hit. I did not use the icing recipe here. M y old recipe had a different icing recipe so I used the following: 1/2 cup butter, 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 tbsp. vanilla, 1 lb. powdered sugar, and 1/4 cup milk.\r\nMelt butter & cocoa together, add rest of ingredients. Spread over marshmallows(I used a jar of marshmallow creme). I did not mix together to resemble mud. Just spread chocolate on top of marshmallow creme and enjoy. Everyone loved it!!",

        "Review": "This is the best version of Mississippi Mud cake there is.  I halved this recipe and baked it in an 8x8 inch square pan.  I used 1 cup of marshmallows and sprinkled them on after 23 minutes of baking.  After sprinkling on the marshmallows, I threw the whole thing in the oven, upped the heat to 400, and \"toasted\" the marshmallows for about 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAlso, this \"cake\" (it's really more like a brownie) simply must have frosting.  While the marshmallows are toasting, melt 4 tablespoons of butter with 3 tablespoons cocoa.  Stir in 1 1/3 cups sifted confectioners sugar, 3 Tablespoons evaporated milk and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Pour over hot cake and let set.",

This one took me about 30 minutes and used ingredients found in almost any American kitchen. For the sauce I used chunky peanut butter (I didn't want a smooth peanut paste), a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of chili sauce and added a tbsp of maple syrup (the Malaysian satay peanut sauce is sweet and spicy). Bottomline: Authentic-tasting? Not really. Easy? YES.",

        "Review": "Hmmm... that was interesting!  I really liked the marinade for the meat, but 2 whole large onions?!? I think that's gotta be a mistake.  I put in one, and there was hardly enough moisture left to accommodate another, let alone the one!  The sauce is good, but a little thick and overpowering.  I was thinking a little chicken broth or something might thin it out and make it more of a sauce than peanut butter with some coconut flavor and spices. I served this as a main dish over rice noodles, and over-all, I think it is worth making again.  I'd definitly like to try the meat skewers on the BBQ.  I bet that would be REALLY good!",

I also cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us.  I left out the butter, and used low fat mushroom soup and added some sauteed mushroom to get another veggie in.  This IS REALLY REALLY GOOD!!  Can't wait to take it for lunch this week.  ",

The honey is still a little runny, but a lot thicker than the first couple days.  I couldn't get enough of this stuff when we had it sitting out.  We put out crackers and vanilla waffers for people to dip in it.  I had a lot of heart burn issues the next morning but it was worth it!

I smothered a slice in skordalia, took a bite and kinda jumped in my seat. I'm not giving it five stars because that would seem a little absurd, but it sure is yummy.",

I left out the cinnamon for us and just added some Louisiana Hot Sauce, which isn't quite as hot as Tabasco, and gave loads of flavor without loads of hotness.  This will be a repeat at our house!",

I reduced the red peppers (I used cayenne) to just a dash because I was worried that it would be too spicy, but the spices mellow a lot during cooking.  Mine were lovely and crisp, chewy and tender (just like hashbrowns should be!)  This is a really nice breakfast recipe, because you can just throw it in the oven while you're making pancakes and eggs on the range and not have to worry about it or deal with another pan on the stove.    Very good flavor and  very nice that you can just put them in the oven and forget them and worry about the rest of the meal!  I love hashbrowns and this is surely a keeper.  ",

I also added coarsely chopped yellow onion.  I didn’t have chili powder on hand so had to “cheat” with some Creole seasoning. The shredded potatoes cooked down quite a lot and I wished I had made more. Everyone wanted thirds. Thanks for this awesome recipe Gay Gilmore.  ",

I chose this recipe because I had everything available on my kitchen shelf and was low fat to boot.  I allowed my hashed browns to defrost quite a bit before cooking, used a small casserole dish, substituted cayenne pepper powder for red pepper, and cooked for recommended length of time.  This made the top nice and brown, and under layers soft.  Served with extra hot sauce, yum!  Easy, quick, and healthful!",

I couldn't taste much spicyness, just a hint, which was good. I ended up with some leftovers which were quickly reheated in a skillet the next day and tasted just as good. Thanks a lot, I'll definitely be making these again!",

Next time I'll make them a little bigger.  The flavor was just enough to tingle but not overpowering, and I added a couple shakes of garlic powder.  I will definitely make these again and try to freeze them and see how they work.  Wonderful, thanks!!!",

The only directions I did follow were the baking directions and how to mix all the ingredients together. The ingredients were simple and the hash browns were easy to make. I just reccomend, for those who like their hash browns a little crunchy, pan frying the hash browns in a greased skillet after they have cooked in the oven. Great recipe!!!",

He enjoyed them, but thought the spice mixture needed just a bit more salt & spice. I used 2 cups diced potatoes, and had already upped the spices but next time will use a bit more! They looked wonderful--crisp on the outside from the oil & had great color. Thanks so much for sharing! I am grateful to add this to his breakfast menu!",

There were a lot of steps, which isn't necessarily a  bad thing, but it didn't fall together like most cake recipes.  For example, I couldn't figure out why I had to melt the butter (and of course cool it) when I was just creaming it, or why add the sugar in two parts.   I had tons of tunnels.  And it would be helpful if there was a number for how long to bake.  At least a range, especially for us novice cooks.   It took 45 minutes for me.",

I barely got 6 jumbo muffins out of it and I used 2 cups chopped apricots and 1/2 cup nuts.\r\nI used dried apricots that I rehydrated with boiling water. Instead of milk I used 1/2 cup apricot water as I knew the rehydrated apricots would not have as much juice as the fresh. I only used 1/3 cup sugar, that's my personal taste, I don't like muffins sweet. These were even too sweet for me. I would use 1/4 cup sugar for my taste. Thanks for a tasty apricot muffin recipe.",

        "Review": "I made this with fresh organic apricots that were too tart to eat out of hand and it turned out wonderfully.  You can really taste the apricots and all the flavors are very well-balanced.  I actually made this as a loaf, rather than muffins (by the way, just to note, 6 jumbo muffins should equal 12 regular-sized muffins, so I think that Dorel was mistaken in that respect).  It turned out with a lovely cake-like crumb, dense and moist.  I was surprised that the recipe instructed to add the apricot so early- most baked good recipes call for any fruit added to be added at the very end so that the fruit isn't broken down.  I think the fact that the apricots were added earlier and mashed a little as I mixed in the other ingredients made the bread moister and infused the whole thing with more apricot flavor.  I made a few subs- I used whole wheat pastry flour rather than all-purpose, sucanat rather than white sugar and butter instead of shortening.  I didn't find it at all too sweet, especially with the fresh apricots which are much less sweet than dried.  I really liked the flavor/texture that the walnuts added.  Just a really lovely bread. I liked it especially refrigerated and sliced thinly- mmm! ",

I did not add nuts to one of the loafs, they do not like nuts either. I am glad \"dawneg\" suggested that. Since I doubled the recipe I put pecans in one loaf for myself. I had pecans at home and used them up in this recipe. When I doubled the recipe I did not double the nutmeg because one person said it was a little much. I may try using a little lemon zest in it next time. Overall fast, easy and good way to use up your apricots.",

The second batch I mixed better to get the pectin in, and didn't like it near as well. I will be making mine in the future without the pectin. I also added about a teaspoon or so of Irish Cream syrup which was marvelous!\r\nThis is a very easy recipe if you have an easy espresso maker.",

It's a 5:1 recipe with sugar to taste-- 5 Milks to 1 espresso.  I put your original recipe mixture in a blender and added ice.  Lovely.  I used semi-skimmed milk but will try skim to lessen the fat calories.  THanks for posting!  Patty from England",

My wife wanted a little more meat so I removed the casing from 3 hot italian sausage links, browned them and added them to the soup, It was delicious. A great winter chowder. The bacon adds great flavor.",

Added about 2T. prepackaged REAL bacon bits to the 1 1/2 slices of bacon I had, used 3 potatoes, 4 c. milk, 2 c. turkey broth I had laying around.  Was out of onion, so used the last of my onion powder and a packet of onion soup mix.  Omitted the red pepper and thyme.  Browned 1 lb cut up pork tenderloin in 2 T. italian dressing and added that at the beginning so it would finish cooking with the rest of the ingred.  Very yummy and easily adapted for people like me! lol :)",

After 45 minutes it was done, so when you try the recipe, give yourself more time than stated.",

Because of picky eaters I used half the amount of vegetables and half the amount of sage. I added a pinch of salt and some garlic powder. It was perfect. I also added a lot more cheese on the top than just 1/2 of a cup. It got toasted golden and crunchy; not ooey gooey; just wonderful. Also note that my dish was ready in 17 minutes, not 30! This would be a super dish to take to a potluck. I can't wait for the opportunity. And lastly, must have mustard to dip! YUM!",

Ketchup and mustard mixed is what topped mine. I thought that it was alittle dry without the toppings. I think next time I'll try some extra onions, celery and cheese in the batter. Still a great tasting casserole for corndog lovers!",

I love corndogs but as they usually have to be fried and i try to not do it, when i found this recipe was very glad that was baked instead. I made some variations though, I used polenta meal with baking powder and all-purpouse flour, instead of the cornbread mix. It's already in my favorites and i will make it more, but i guess will use something else like mushrooms instead of celery :).Tnx 4 sharing",

Making a half-batch trial run of the recipe might be a good idea for first-timers.",

I omitted the sage, green onion and celery because I knew my kids would not like it. We had mustard and ketchup at the table to dip. My son is taking some to school for lunch tomorrow, and he really had fun helping me make it. Thanks for the recipe! :)",

Anyway the 14 year old and I thought is was okay at best.  I didn't include the celery or sage because that would have been a guaranteed no from picky pete.  It was quick to put together and nice baking time.",

There was not a bite left over.  Such a differant dish with flavors that remind you of those fair corn dogs, but with enough extra to make it a meal.  I baked in an iron skillet mainly for the looks and it turned out great.  I'm sure another less picky eater will enjoy it so planning to make it again when my DGSs come to visit.",

The recipe is dead easy and the results were surprisingly good. I would recommend this for a buffet at a party(with toothpicks for that 60's kitch feel). One adaptation I suggest is to increase the worcestershire and add cayenne or tabasco to taste, simmer the sauce without the meatballs, and barbecue some ribs using this as the barbecue sauce. Yum! Pass the cole slaw, please.",

        "Review": "My father made a variation of this recipe.  He simply boiled the meatballs in the chili sauce/grape jelly mixture.  The meatballs consisted of salt abd beef...period.  I thought I could make them better, and richer.  So, I made my meatballs (sometimes making them like normal meatballs, with breadcrumbs, etc., and sometimes just seasoning the beef, and rolling it into balls), and baked them uncovered in the oven.  I drain whatever oil is there, if any, cover with the pre-made sauce (simmered while the meatballs bake), and bake for another 30 minutes or so, to bake the sauce on.  One other variation of mine, is lemon pepper added to the meatballs, and to the sauce.  If I am out, I will just use lemon juice.  The lemon pepper (or juice) adds a great taste to them!",

However, I put my meatballs into the crockpot raw and let them cook in the sauce for several hours, it give the meatballs a much better taste (beware of this method if you are not using a very lean meat or you will have to much excess grease). I nix the worcestershire sauce and add a dash of lemon juice and hot sauce...PERFECT! ",

I didn't follow the instructions 100% and made the meatballs of 2 pounds of Hamburger, 2 eggs and a package of onion soup mix, which made for an enhanced sweet and salty flavor.  Although I didn't care for the sauce myself, my friends loved them.  So, for a convenient tasty party food it worked out just fine.  I'll do it again but I'm going to enhance the chili flavor either by adding chili powder or increasing the amount of chili sauce.  Overall, a success!",

The chicken was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Delicious! will try it with other salad dressing/cracker combinations.",

        "Review": "This meal couldn't be easier to fix, and it is yummy as well. Versatile too -- any dressing or crackers will work.  I used chicken tenders and cooked for about 12 minutes.  The ranch dressing gave the chicken a twist, a nice change from the breaded chicken sauteed in olive oil that had been the usual in my house. Definitely one for those busy weekday nights!",

The only problem I had was that they didn't brown as well as I had hoped.  After 20 minutes, I took them out and sprayed lightly with Olive Oil cooking spray to try to get them a little more brown and cooked them an additional 5 minutes.  I'll be making these again.  thanks  Made for I Recommend Game.",

I rolled mine in some great crackers, and added a bit of pepper, cayenne as it gave it even more of a boost. Thanks so much Dave!",

The cucumber sauce (we know it as tzatziki) was great, although I couldnt get hold of any mint, fresh or dried, so left it out. I've just returned from a holiday in Greece so this was a fantastic meal for us to relive the wonderful food there! I will definitely be making again, thanks for sharing.",

I can't imagine how even more delicious it is with the marinade at 24 hours.  The cucumber sauce was also one of the best we have ever had.  I didn't have mint, and substituted tarragon in it's place.  It worked perfectly.",

This is a nice recipe for the tzatziki, using fresh mint. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken or fire up the gril, but the flavors came through just fine because I pan fried the chicken and the marinade together in a skillet on medium heat. As the chicken cooked, the marinade reduced and evaporated...then the chicken quickly browned beautifully, with a coating of those concentrated flavors.",

I made a triple batch because I was planning on using them for a party that had to be canceled. They were gone in two days with only 3 people in the house. I literally had to hide them from my son because he couldn't keep his hands off. He just kept popping them in his mouth. I ate them on a Greek salad. They ate them in pita pockets stuffed with veggies. The cucumber sauce was great too. Thanks. I will be making this again!",

I prefer greek yogurt for my sauce. I actually served mine in a Naan bread with, diced tomatoes and some crisp lettuce.  It made a great sandwich.  I could easily served it as a full meal as well.  Very nice flavors. I had a light artichoke, olive salad as a small side dish.\nThx for a nice recipe.",

I only made two small changes: I added slightly more garlic (I tend to always do that) and in step 4, as well as the specified amount of lemon juice, instead of water, I added some white wine.  This was really tasty warm (I’d defy anyone to resist trying it the dish at this point) but even more delicious at room temperature.  To me this looked more like a serving for 4, but it depends how many other dishes are to be served with it.  I could also imagine 1 or 2 scoffing it down without any difficulty!  Thanks so much for sharing.  A five plus recipe!  I’ll be making this again.",

I think that this recipe would be great without the water, I thought that it diluted the flavors.  I am going to try it again without the water.  Thanks for the recipe!",

My son and I both loved it -- and I generally do not eat fish.\r\n\r\nI had about 1.6lbs of salmon cut into 4 filets. The recipe here was sufficient for that. I pan cooked for 8 minutes on each side starting with skin side down. I still spooned some marinade over the filets and covered while they cooked.",

It turned out great, slightly carmelized on the outside, tender and delicious on the inside. This is a great marinade for fish, but would also be good for chicken or pork. Served with balsamic asparagus, cinnamon-butter yeast rolls, and roasted herb potatoes. Yum!",

Grated ginger is great too.  I also added cornstarch to reserve, heated and served it over top the salmon.  You can do so much with this as a base.  GREAT recipe!",

Of course, like others have suggested, I marinated for 3 days AND used more bourbon (about 3 ounces), and sesame oil.  One additional touch, I cooked the filets on cedar planks on my gas bbq.  Result -- FANTASTIC!!  Served with my Corn-Tomato-and-Black-Bean-Salsa.  Made a big hit!!",

        "Review": "Nice and simple - with full, pure flavor.  Like other reviewers, I added some garlic powder.  I found it very time consuming to brush all the pepper strips with oil on both sides (I used six big bell peppers - green, red, and yellow), so next time, I'll just throw all the strips in one or two big ziploc gallon bags, add my oil, salt, pepper, and garlic, and shake to distribute evenly.  Despite the caveat to season the peppers LIGHTLY, I ended up adding a lot more salt to really pull out the flavor. Great with grilled salmon and Wild Rice Casserole(Recipe #42899)",

I made it again using my own sauce recipe#60997 and our favourite toppings. I froze the unbaked pizzas for a quick meal on another day and this crust was fabulous! I will add this to my OAMC cookbook. This recipe was a real winner and I plan to make it often. ",

(1 teaspoon per cup of flour) The dough is tender on a thick crust and good and crispy on a thin crust. It makes a great stuffed crust and a calzone too! I like that it is a large recipe, so instead of 4 batches I only need to make 1 at a time. I haven&#039;t tried freezing, but I bet it will do well.",

The consistency of this soup I will try to change somehow it reminded me of curdled milk so I will probably omit the potato flakes and the mayonnaise hoping it will just be smoother.  I made this last night and I will make it again for it reminds me of my mom & Grandma's German poatato soup.  Oh and I didn't have any red pepper but it was still very filling!",

        "Review": "Thanks for steering to this one Uncle Bill. Its outstanding! (as was expected). Took me a minute to understand the soup base ingredient. Essentially, I made 4 cups of chicken broth and then added 2.5 cups of veggie broth (or chicken broth if you choose). The cheese combination was perfectly balanced. Not overly cheesy... just well balanced. Next time I'm going to change the brand of instant potatoes I used (it made the texture a little grainy) but the soup was fabulous nonetheless. THanks.

I loved the unexpected mayonnaise, no one could guess what the surprise ingredient was, when told it was Mayonnaise they all looked at me with shock and disbelieve.  I served this with Normâ€™s Quick Rolls, another great soup night.  Thank you for one more amazing recipe.",

I used regular mayo and added 1/4 cup sugar - works just the same.  I also left out the process cheese and substituted Parmesan cheese for the Swiss.  Still great!",

After adding the eggs and flour, the mess made me glad I used the bag. I wasn't sure about how it was going to be when done as it looked like it was going to be a very heavy coating. The only changes I made was to reduce the amount of soy sauce and to use only two eggs. The chicken turned out moist and full of flavor.  The only changes I'd make the next time I make this is omit the salt and use a low sodium soy sauce (I should have noticed the amount of sodium from the nutrition facts). Thank you for sharing this recipe :)  Note: the coating in the batch I made was best if eaten immediately.",

I'm going to serve it with whole wheat crackers and blanched broccoli Put the pepper in the blender before the feta so as not to clog the blade(probably common knowledge). The pepper adds such a nice sweetness it might not even require the pinch of sugar - taste it first. I might use one more pepper next time because it was really \"feta-y\".  Thanks for posting!",

I picked up a couple tips from other reicpes on this site: (1) Pat the dogs dry with a paper towel before dipping, and (2) Put the batter in a tall glass to dip. We put them on wooden skewers for frying, and also put a bit of hot pepper in the batter for more flavor. Quick and easy, and practically no dishes to wash!",

We had leftover batter, which we dropped into the oil to fry too, and they turned out as delicious little pastries!",

        "Review": "I added 1 t dry mustard, paprika, a dash of cayenne and also used 1/2 polenta and 1/2 corn 'flour' for the cornmeal component.  I cut 'village keilbasa' (selsko kolbacitz) in half, blotted them with paper towels and lightly dusted them with flour before dunking them in the batter.  They held together just fine in my deep fryer.  My guests said they were great, but I am coming down with cold, so unfortunately, nothing tasted good to me last night :-(.  I used the excess batter to make some impromptu onion wedges.  Everything got eaten!  Will try again and update the review to reflect a non-illness influenced personal opinion!",

We poured the batter in a 20 oz. styrofoam cup and it worked great for dipping then just threw it away for easy clean up. The corn dogs turned out brown and crunchy. Just delicious !! Will be making again. Thank you for the recipe !",

        "Review": "Just like I said for my home state of Illinois, I'll say here for my neighbor across the river....Iowa. This doesn't represent Iowa at all in the area where I spent my life. I was born and raised in Illinois, but we crossed the bridge over the Mississippi and were in Davenport, Iowa. People in our neck of the woods live for Pork. And the favorite dish in the bi-state area where I'm from, is the Pork Tenderloin. A piece of pork loin is flattened out so it's as big as your head, fried in a crust like you'd use for chicken fried steak, then put on a hamburger bun which makes it look ridiculously small when the pork is as big as a dinner plate! We always ate ours with yellow mustard, onions and pickles. Now THAT is Illinois/Iowa where I'm from.",

Didn't have any maple syrup so had to setle for Mrs. Butterworth's Syrup, still excellent though. I doubled the batch for our large family. I dropped the batter by rounded Tablespoons and it made 30 fritters",

I like mine to have a nice salty flavor.  You need to have your oil fairly hot (at least on medium), so it sizzles when you add the batter.  I didn't shape mine into balls and flatten, I just spooned mine into the oil and then flattened with the back of the spoon.  That's how my Mom did it.  Thanks for the recipe, it brought back good memories of home!",

They still had a bit of crunch but were hot through and browned on the outside.  The bit of sugar is excellent it cuts the sharp taste that some green tomatoes  tend to have",

        "Review": "Fried green tomatoes are great. Sometimes I use bacon grease to fry them in, or mix a little in with the butter. This also helps if you don't want to use the sugar, the bacon grease often reduces the sourness of the green toms without needing to add sugar (for those with sugar limitations).",

Thank you so much for posting it!  ;)  When my hubby asked if I'd make some fried green tomatoes w/dinner I was a little nervous because I'd never even tasted them!  After following this recipe (and adding about 1T canola oil w/the melted butter for longer frying) he said they were the best he'd ever had. Thanks again!!",

I did use Splenda (one packet; one tomato) and I added a little bacon grease to the butter as someone suggested.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next tomato I pick will meet it&#039;s end in the same way.

The only difference that I do to this recipe is I use whole milk sometimes.  It works just as great and works in a pinch if you don't have buttermilk on hand. Even though I believe the buttermilk method is better myself.  My grandma and mom made it that way and it reminds me of them and home everytime I make it.",

I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 cup of milk with about 1 Tbsp. of lemon juice added to it. (This is the substitute if you don't have buttermilk.) I used yellow squash and zucchini from our garden. I soaked the slices in the milk for about 20 or 30 minutes. And I believe that this is the secret. They had a buttery taste to them and were equally good alone as well as with dipping in ranch dressing. Thanks M for a great recipe. I've fried zucchini before but I think this is the recipe I'll use from now on.",

Used Southerngals' suggestion with milk & lemon juice for soaking. Fried in cast iron skillet... Pure Heaven!! I can't wait to do this with green tomatos. Thank you for a definite keeper!!",

I had it in the crock pot for 6 hours on low, because the balls were a little bigger than walnut size. When I looked in on them when time was up the sauce looked really gross looking with like clumps of discolored stuff, but I though I could fix that if the taste of the meatballs were good. But I tried one and said no....the aftertaste was not good, not sure if it had to do with lemon or what. Even asked my DD to try and she said could we have something else for diner please after trying.  I a so sorry Doreen. Maybe it was the meat, no clue.",

Made about 20-24 appetizer size pieces.  \r\n\r\nI made it in a 10\" springform pan and used 3 different kinds of onion (2.5 c cooking, 1 c red, .25 c green), totalling about 3.5-4 cups.\r\n\r\nWhen I make it again I will only make about .75 of the dough recipe as I found it a bit thick.  This dough would also be excellent as a base for strawberry shortcake although I wouldn't add the additional salt.    \r\n\r\n",
